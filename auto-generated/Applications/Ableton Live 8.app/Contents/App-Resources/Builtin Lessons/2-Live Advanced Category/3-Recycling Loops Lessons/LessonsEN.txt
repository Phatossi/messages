In addition to its excellent mixing options, $0 offers a range of tools for remixing and recycling musical material. In this lesson, we'll explore the many possibilities offered by $0's powerful /clip envelopes./

*Please click $Link here <Set:/Sets/Recycling Loops.als> to load the Live Set that accompanies this lesson.*
Divider.tif

Let's launch the first scene so that we can get a feel for our Set:
SceneLaunch1.tif

We can /solo/ the "vox hits" clip using the "Hits" track's /Solo switch:/
SoloRecycling.tif

Let's say that we like the vocal sound in this loop, but we don't really want to use the rest: This is a perfect task for a clip envelope. Click /Next Page/ below to proceed.

$Page Clip Envelopes 
$TargetName Clip Envelopes

To access clip envelopes, we double-click the playing "vox hits" clip to open it in the /Clip View./ You can also create more screen space by clicking on the /Show/Hide Sample Box button/ located at the lower left corner of the screen:
ShowHideSampleBoxLoops.tif

The /Envelopes box/ features quick-chooser buttons for selecting commonly modulated clip parameters. We can select the clip's /volume envelope/ with the one shown below:
VolumeQuickChooser.tif

Now, we'll probably want to zoom out so that we can see our entire clip in the /Envelope Editor/ at the right-hand side of the screen. Zooming is done with the /beat ruler/ at the top of the display:
BeatRulerRecycling.tif

Clicking and dragging up or down in the beat ruler will smoothly zoom out or in. Clicking and dragging left or right in the beat ruler will scroll the display left or right.

$Page Drawing Envelopes 
$TargetName Drawing Envelopes

Let's /draw/ a volume envelope curve onto the sample waveform shown in the Clip View. To do so, we'll first activate /Draw Mode/ in the Control Bar with this switch:
DrawSwitchMix.tif

Now, draw a volume envelope curve that allows only the vocals to play unmuted, like this:
VocalsOnlyEnvelope.tif

You can deactivate soloing on this track to bring in the rest of the mix and hear your changes in context.

$Page Using Effects 
$TargetName Using Effects

Clip envelopes can be used to change pitch, panning or any effect parameter, giving you an exciting amount of control over the shape and character of your sound.

An envelope has previously been drawn for the /Resonators/ effect on this track. The envelope has been drawn on the "vox hits" clip below the one we're currently using, so you can launch this clip now:
LaunchSecondVox.tif

Please double-click the title bar of the "Hits" track to open it in the Track View at the bottom of the screen.
Track2TitleBar.tif

Now, activate Resonators with the button in its upper left corner.
ResonatorsActive.tif

You can also use the N key on your computer keyboard, which has been previously assigned to this switch, to toggle the effect on and off.

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Modulating Effects Controls 
$TargetName Modulating Effects Controls

To see the envelope that has been drawn for the effect's /Dry/Wet control,/ double-click the playing "vox hits" clip so that it shows up in the Clip View down below. Then, select "Resonators" from the top chooser in the Envelopes box:
ResonatorsInChooser.tif

If you haven't already, momentarily solo this track in order to listen more closely to the effect of the clip envelope.

You can edit the envelope by drawing on it or by /deactivating/ Draw Mode to work with /breakpoints,/ which are described in more detail in the lesson on $Link automation <Lesson:Builtin/2-Live Advanced Category/2-Using Automation>.

/Tip:/ Pressing $ShiftMod + Tab will quickly toggle the Track and Clip Views.

$Page Modulating Mixer Controls 
$TargetName Modulating Mixer Controls

Let's look at an example of a /mixer control/ affected by clip envelopes. Select "Mixer" from the top chooser and "Track Panning" from the bottom chooser, like this:
PanInChooser.tif

If you look at the track's /Pan control/ in the mixer, you will notice that it moves in accordance with the panning clip envelope.
PanGhost.tif

$Page Scrambling Beats 
$TargetName Scrambling Beats

Yet another creative use of clip envelopes is to use them to scramble a beat.

Please solo the "Hip Hop" track, and then launch the lower "hiphop 95" clip to hear a beat-scrambling clip envelope in action.
HipHop95Low.tif

Now, double-click the clip to open it in the Clip View. Select "Clip" in the top envelope chooser to see the clip envelope shown below.
BeatScrambler.tif

This envelope is modulating the /sample offset/ of the loop, jogging the start point and reinterpreting the sample as the loop plays.

$Page Creating Long Variations 
$TargetName Creating Long Variations

To listen to one last example of clip envelopes, please solo the "Synth" track.

Play the upper "synth" clip first, and then compare it with the lower "synth" clip. You will notice that the one-bar synth loop in the first clip has been reworked as a variation in the second, where it develops and changes over four bars. Let's get a closer look by double-clicking the lower "synth" clip to open it in the Clip View.

There are two elements to our clip variation. First, take a look at the clip's envelopes in the two choosers. Select "Clip" from the upper chooser to see the transposition envelope that has been drawn:
TransposeEnvelope.tif

Secondly, the transposition envelope has been /unlinked/ from the /one-bar loop,/ so that it has a separate length of /four bars./  This was accomplished by turning on the /Unlink Envelope switch.../
UnlinkEnvelope.tif

... and setting the /length of the envelope/ to 4 bars.
FourBarEnvelope.tif

$Page Try It Yourself 
$TargetName Try It Yourself

To wrap this up, let's just say that there's no better way to experience the power of $0's clip envelopes and mixing potential than to try it yourself. But don't take it from us, try it yourself and make your own mix!

When editing your own clip envelopes, it will sometimes be convenient to view /only/ those clip parameters which have envelopes. You can do this by choosing /Show Modulated Parameters Only/ from either of the envelope choosers. In this mode, each clip's two envelope choosers will unite into one, which will show only /modulated/ clip parameters. To again deactivate this special mode, select /Show All Modulations/ from the chooser.

Clip envelopes can create infinite variations on loops, samples and even MIDI, making your imagination the only limit. Clip envelopes are covered in detail in the "Clip Envelopes" chapter of the $Link reference manual <Manual>, which includes information on unlinking envelopes, modulating mixer and effects controls and even creating clip envelopes for MIDI. The electronic reference manual is always available via the program's /Help/ menu.

Remember also that everything you do as you mix can be recorded and edited as an Arrangement. For details, please see "Recording Sessions into the Arrangement" in the $Link reference manual <Manual>.
