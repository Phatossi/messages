At the end of the $Link Live Tour <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/1-A Tour of Live>, we saw how musical sketches and ideas can be recorded into $0's /Arrangement View/ as linear arrangements. In this lesson, we'll look at the Arrangement View's powerful editing tools.

Divider.tif
*Whenever you're ready, please click $Link here <Set:/Sets/Editing Arrangements.als> to load the Live Set that accompanies this lesson.*
Divider.tif

Before we start, let's make more room for the Arrangement View by folding away the /Browser/ on the left-hand side of the screen with its /Show/Hide button,/ shown below.
ShowHideBrowser.tif

You'll probably also want to use the Mixer Section selectors on the right-hand side of the screen to show the only section we might need - the /Mixer section/ - and hide the others:
MixerSectionShow2.tif

When you're ready, click /Next Page/ below to proceed.

$Page Playing Arrangements 
$TargetName Playing Arrangements

You can *always* start and stop playback by pressing the space bar on your computer keyboard. Reset the playback position to 1.1.1 by pressing the Control Bar's /Stop Button/ twice.
TransportStopButtonArr.tif

Let the song play for a bit, and then stop it with the space bar. Click somewhere right below the "Bass B1" clip, which will move the pulsing /insert marker:/
InsertMarker.tif

When you press the space bar again, playback will start from this marker. If you prefer to resume from the point at which you stopped, hold $ShiftMod while pressing the space bar.

Stop playback, and click on the "Bass B1" clip's colored title bar to select it.
SelectedClipArr.tif

When the clip is selected this way, play will start at the clip's left end and continue on into the rest of the Arrangement. If you hold down $CopyMod while starting playback, it will stop at the end of the selected area (in this case, at the end of the clip).

$Page Using the Beat Ruler 
$TargetName Using the Beat Ruler

The Arrangement View currently shows only part of our song at any one time, but we can get a broader idea of what is happening by zooming out.

The key to zooming in $0's Arrangement View is the /beat ruler,/ located at the top of the Arrangement View:
TimeRuler.tif

Let your cursor hover over the beat ruler, and notice that it turns into a magnifying glass. If you are currently playing the Arrangement, press the space bar to stop. Now, click and /drag slowly up/ to zoom out and see the full Arrangement.

The /Unfold Track button,/ shown below and located next to a track's name, will fold or unfold a track, showing or hiding the contents of its clips.
FoldingAllTracks.tif

Fold away the contents of clips in /all/ tracks by /$OptionMod-clicking/ on this button. We can now see our Arrangement in a more compact form:
CompactArrangement.tif

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Jumping and Scrubbing 
$TargetName Jumping and Scrubbing

The area above the uppermost track is called the /scrub area./ It's partly covered by the /loop brace,/ which we'll inspect in a moment. First however, try moving the mouse over the parts of the scrub area above or below the loop brace.
ScrubAreaArr.tif

By default, the cursor turns into a speaker icon. You can use this tool to click in the scrub area at any point and start playback from there, or to jump from point to point in the Arrangement.

The size and timing of these jumps are quantized according to the /Global Quantization/ chooser's setting:
GlobalQuantizationArr.tif

While the mouse is held down over the scrub area, a portion of the Arrangement the size of the chosen quantization setting will be repeatedly played. With small quantization settings, or a setting of /None,/ this allows you to scrub through the music.

*Tip:* If you're worried about accidentally scrubbing during a performance, you can disable this scrub area by turning off "Permanent Scrub Areas" in Live's $Link Look/Feel Preferences <Pref:LookFeel>.
PermanentScrubPref.tif

When off, the regions above and below the beat ruler both zoom, but you can still temporarily toggle scrubbing by holding down $ShiftMod while dragging in the scrub area.

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Locators 
$TargetName Locators

/Locators/ help with editing and arranging by marking certain points in the Arrangement. To set a locator, click on the /Set Locator button,/ shown below. Your new locator will appear in the scrub area.
LocatorSetButtonArr.tif

While the song is running, locators can be "dropped" at the current playback position (quantized according to the global quantization setting). While the song is stopped, locators are created at the insert marker or selection start.
NewLocatorArr.tif

You can recall (jump to) locators by clicking on them, or with the /Previous/ and /Next Locator buttons/ on either side of the Set button.
PrevNextButtonArr.tif

Locator recall is subject to quantization, just like any click in the scrub area. Double-clicking a locator will select it and start Arrangement playback from that point. Locators can be dragged with the mouse or moved with the arrow keys on your computer keyboard.

To name a locator, select it with the mouse, and choose /Rename/ from the Edit menu ($CommandMod + R). To remove a locator, select it and press your keyboard's backspace/delete key.

You can $ContextMenu on a locator and select /Set Song Start Time Here/ from the context menu in order to set that locator as the playback start point.

$Page Setting a Loop 
$TargetName Setting a Loop

Let's say we want to focus on editing the "Pad B2" clip:
PadB2Clip.tif

We probably want to /loop/ the clip so that we can listen to it repeatedly. To do this, we need to enclose it in the /loop brace,/ shown below.
LoopMarkers.tif

The edges of the loop brace can be dragged into position. Click and drag the left edge so that it lines up with the beginning of the "Pad B2" clip (Bar 29).
PadBeginning.tif

Next, click and drag the right edge so that it lines up with the end of the clip (Bar 33).
PadEnd.tif

Divider.tif
/Hint:/ You can quickly set the loop brace to the exact size of a clip by clicking on the clip to select it and pressing $CommandMod-L. Also, whenever the loop is only partially visible and you want to move the end that is outside of the visible range, you don't have to scroll. You can always grab the start or end point from the view border.

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Activating Looping 
$TargetName Activating Looping

Before we can listen to our loop, we need to make sure that the Control Bar's /Loop switch/ is activated, as shown below.
ArrangementLoopSwitch.tif

Now, please press the space bar to hear the loop you have created, and stop again when you are done.
DesiredRegion.tif

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Zooming in on a Selection 
$TargetName Zooming in on a Selection

Let's use the beat ruler to get a closer look at the clips we intend to edit. Place the cursor somewhere near bar 31, then click and /drag slowly down/ to zoom in on the section of the song containing the "Pad B2" clip.
PadClipTime.tif

Since we're trying to focus on this entire section, we also may need to /drag left and right to scroll,/ as well as zooming in (or back out), so that we can see all of the clip in the Arrangement View.

Divider.tif
*Clicking and dragging up or down in the beat ruler will smoothly zoom out or in.*

*Clicking and dragging left or right in the beat ruler will scroll the display left or right.*

$Page Using the Loop Brace 
$TargetName Using the Loop Brace

$0's loop brace simplifies quite a few editing tasks. Let's say that we want to halve the length of our region.

To select the region in question, we can just click on the loop brace. The brace will turn solid black when selected:
SelectedBrackets.tif

Hold down $CommandMod, and press your arrow down key, halving the length of the loop:
HalvedLoop.tif

Now, (without holding $CommandMod) press the arrow up key, moving the loop one loop length to the right.
MovedLoop.tif

You've probably noticed that your edited loop brace doesn't line up evenly with the barlines. This is because the "Pad B2" clip (and thus our original loop) was a strange length to begin with, due to the fact that it crossed a /time signature change./ In cases like this, you may need to manually adjust the length of the brace after moving it around. If necessary, adjust the loop brace so that it stretches from bar 31 to bar 33, as shown below:
AdjustedLoop.tif

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Editing Clips 
$TargetName Editing Clips

Any part of the song or Arrangement that is /selected/ can then be /edited/ with commands from the /Edit/ menu. The region currently enclosed by the loop brace, for example, can now be edited quite easily:

We simply make sure that the loop brace is still selected (solid black), which simultaneously /selects/ the material within; then we choose a command from the /Edit/ menu, /Delete,/ for example.
SelectedLoop.tif


Divider.tif
Generally speaking, Arrangement View Edit menu commands are of two types: common editing commands such as Cut, Duplicate and Delete apply to clips and their contents, while the /...Time/ commands apply to spans of time in the Arrangement.

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Nondestructive Editing 
$TargetName Nondestructive Editing

$0 keeps a log of all your actions in the program, so you can always change your mind and roll events backward in time to any point.

Let's say you didn't like the effect of the /Delete/ command for some reason. You can always press $CommandMod + Z once to /undo/ your last edit step. Then, you can change your mind again and /redo/ the last step. On a PC, use $CommandMod + Y for this; on a Mac, $CommandMod + $ShiftMod + Z.
DeletedLoop.tif

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Editing Clips, Continued 
$TargetName Editing Clips, Continued

/Clip length/ can easily be changed by clicking and dragging at either /clip edge./  Notice that the cursor will turn into a bracket when it is hovering over either end of a clip, letting you know that the length can be changed.

To fill in the empty space created by our deletion, let's make a /copy/ of the "Drums B2" clip. We can do this simply by clicking and /$CopyMod-dragging/ the clip to where we want it:
DrumsPasted.tif

Let's also extend the "Pad B2" clip a bit earlier by changing its length.

Click at the right edge of "Pad B2" and drag it slowly to the right, so that it extends to the beginning of bar 33, as shown below.
PadExtended.tif

Notice that we still have a small patch of empty space left over from when we deleted our time signature change. The clips after it all start at what used to be the beginning of a 4/4 measure. But now they're offset by a beat. To fix this, select the empty space between 33 and 33.2 in one of the tracks:
EmptySpace.tif

Then choose /Delete Time/ from the Edit menu.

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Using the Grid 
$TargetName Using the Grid

As you edit clips in the Arrangement View, you might notice that both clip movements and length changes /snap to the visible grid lines./

You can change grid density using the context menu: Just $ContextMenu anywhere in the Arrangement View where there are no clips.
GridContextMenuArr.tif

The grid has two modes that govern how it behaves during zooming:
-> /Adaptive Grid:/ When you zoom in or out, grid lines appear or disappear so that they remain equidistant.
-> /Fixed Grid:/ Grid lines have fixed spacing, regardless of the zoom factor.

The grid can also be switched off or set to triplet spacing.

The current width of the grid is displayed at the lower right of the Arrangement View, like so:
GridWidthDisplayArr.tif

$Page Consolidating Clips 
$TargetName Consolidating Clips

Now, we can listen to the effects of our editing on the whole song by pressing the Stop button in the Control Bar twice (resetting the play position to 1.1.1), deactivating the Loop switch and pressing the space bar.

$0 offers in-depth editing of individual clip properties, and while we will not be covering this in our lesson, we will now learn how the Arrangement View offers you an option for /consolidating/ multiple clips in the same track, so that their properties can be adjusted in unison.

To see how consolidating works, let's return to our 4-bar loop. Stop playback with the space bar and make the loop length 4 bars, starting from bar 29. (You may have to /zoom out/ to see the whole range.) Your loop should then look something like this:
LikeThis.tif

Please click on the loop brace, turning it solid black and selecting the material within for editing.

Now, select /Consolidate/ from the /Edit/ menu, and watch as each track's clips are consolidated into one:
IntoOne.tif

$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Splitting Clips 
$TargetName Splitting Clips

Let's unfold all the tracks by pressing the triangular Unfold Track button with the $OptionMod modifier key held down.

Just as $0 allows consolidating multiple clips, it also allows /splitting/ a single clip into more than one. Let's try splitting the "Drums B2" clip that is currently within our loop brace. (You may have to scroll down using the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the Arrangement View.)

Click within the clip's MIDI note display (not its title bar) at bar 30, as shown here:
BlinkingCursor.tif

The insert marker will show you the point at which the clip will split. 

You can also isolate a portion of a clip by selecting a chunk of its time and splitting. This creates a split at both edges of the selection. Select the contents of bar 30 by dragging within the note display to the beginning of bar 31:
SplitRegion.tif

All that's left is to select the /Split/ command from the Edit menu.

Now, you can click and drag one of the two new clips to any position in the track, replacing what was there before:
Replaced.tif
