A high-quality compressor, such as Live's built-in /Compressor/ device is one of the most important utilities in your mixing toolkit. It's also one of the most easily misunderstood. In this lesson, you'll learn how to get the most out of Compressor, and learn some advanced compression techniques such as sidechaining. Along the way, we'll also explore how sidechaining can be used as a powerful sound design tool in Live's /Auto Filter./

This Set consists of three tracks, with clips arranged into scenes that allow you to quickly try out a few combinations of drums, bass and pad elements. For now, we'll be working with the "Drums" clip alone. Trigger this clip's play button to start it.
DrumsAlone.tif

As the clip is playing, let's add a Compressor device to the drum track. To do this, open Live's /Device Browser./
OpenDeviceBrowser.tif

Then open the Audio Effects folder and navigate to the Compressor device. Drag and drop the Compressor anywhere on the "Drums" track to insert it. It will then appear in the Track View after the Drum Rack.
CompressorInTrack.tif

Since the default settings don't have much of an effect on this signal, you can also try out some of the included Compressor presets to get a quick overview of the kinds of sounds available. Click on the /Hot-Swap/ button to enable Compressor for preset hotswapping.
HotSwapButton.tif

This will also unfold the Compressor's presets in the Device Browser. You can now go down the list and double-click the presets to quickly replace the current settings.

$TargetName Compression Basics

In technical terms, a compressor is part of a category of effects known as /dynamic range/ processors. The dynamic range of a signal is the ratio between the loudest and quietest portions of the signal. A compressor's job is to reduce the dynamic range of a signal by lowering the volume of the loud portions.

Here is a portion of an uncompressed audio waveform, with a large dynamic range:
UncompressedWave.tif

The same audio after compression, with a reduced dynamic range:
CompressedWave.tif

Think of a compressor as an automatic mixing assistant, whose only job is to turn down the volume when it exceeds a certain level. This level is known as the /threshold./ The amount of volume reduction is determined by the /ratio,/ with higher ratios resulting in more volume reduction (and thus less dynamic range). The speed at which the compressor begins working after a signal exceeds the threshold is determined by its /attack/ time, while the /release/ adjusts how quickly the level returns to normal after the signal drops below the threshold. 

Threshold, ratio, attack and release are the most important parameters for shaping your signal's dynamic range, and they can be found on almost all types of compressors. Try experimenting with these, and any other of Compressor's controls, before moving on.

*Note:* For a detailed overview of all of Compressor's parameters, we recommend reading the section on Compressor in the "Live Audio Effect Reference" chapter of the $Link manual <Manual>.

$Page Introducing Sidechaining 
$TargetName Introducing Sidechaining

Normally, a compressor lowers the level of a signal when its volume exceeds the threshold. In some cases, though, we might want to lower the volume of a signal when /another/ signal's level exceeds the threshold. This technique is known as /ducking,/ and is accomplished by using sidechain compression.

For example, when basslines and kick drums have a lot of frequency overlap, the bassline can often "drown out" the kick drum's attack. But by using the kick drum's level to trigger a compressor on the bassline, we can cause the bass's level to "duck" to make room for the kick drum. 

To learn how to set this up, start by triggering the second scene, called "Drums + Bass."
DrumsBassScene.tif

As you can hear, there are some pretty serious problems with our mix. The bassline is much too loud in relation to the drums, and seems to take energy and punch away from the mix. We can try turning the Bass channel's level down, but this seems to quickly make it too quiet. What's the problem?

$Page Frequency Interference 
$TargetName Frequency Interference

To understand why we're having such a hard time mixing, let's take a look at the actual frequency content of our material by clicking on the title bar of the Master track to select it:
MasterTitleBar.tif

This will reveal a /Spectrum/ device in the Master track's Track View:
Spectrum.tif

Spectrum is a tool that gives a realtime look at the strength of individual frequencies in your audio signal. Use the mixer's solo buttons to alternate between soloing the Drums and Bass tracks while looking at Spectrum's display. This should show you where the dominant frequencies are in each track.
SoloButtons.tif

It's easy to see that both tracks produce a large peak in one particular frequency area. If we mouse over this peak in Spectrum's display, its amplitude, frequency and note name appear in a small box in the bottom left corner.
SpectrumPeaks.tif

Now we know where the problem is in our mix - the kick drum and bassline both have a large amount of energy around 43 Hz, causing them to interfere with each other. But how can we fix it?

$Page Ducking a Bassline 
$TargetName Ducking a Bassline

You've already experimented, to little effect, with adjusting the volume of the Bass track. Now try adding a Compressor to this track and adjusting the parameters to see if you can improve the mix.

This isn't really working either. Because our bassline has a very consistent level and no real transients, there's not much for the compressor to do. It's really just functioning like an additional volume control.

Sidechaining offers another solution. To show Compressor's sidechain controls, click the toggle button in its title bar.
SidechainToggle.tif

Now click the /Sidechain/ button to enable external sidechaining.
SidechainButton.tif
*Note:* Sidechaining is not available if Compressor's /Model/ switch is set to /FB./

This enables the /Audio From/ routers in the Compressor device, which allow us to select audio from another track as the trigger or /key/ for Compressor's threshold. We want the kick drum to function as our key, so select "Drums" in the top chooser and "Drums | Kick | Post Mixer" in the bottom chooser.

Now, the compressor lowers the volume of the bassline whenever the kick drum's level exceeds the threshold.

*Tip:* for the famous "pumping" sound associated with classic French house music, try the settings below (or click $Link here <Set:/Sets/Compression and Sidechaining Pumping.als> to load our version):
-> Threshold: very low (-40 dB or more)
-> Ratio: the higher the better
-> Attack: 2-8 ms
-> Release: 35-45 ms, depending on the Threshold and Ratio

$Page Other Sidechaining Applications 
$TargetName Other Sidechaining Applications

Although sidechaining is most commonly associated with compressors, Live also includes sidechaining options in the /Auto Filter/ and /Gate/ effects. Let's examine how to use sidechaining in the Auto Filter to add rhythmic interest to a static pad sound. To start, trigger the "Drums + Bass + Pad" scene.
DrumBassPadScene.tif

As you can hear, the new pad layer is fairly bland. Now add an Auto Filter effect by dragging it from the Audio Effects folder of the Device Browser and dropping it on the Pad track.
FilterInBrowser.tif

As you did with Compressor, open the Auto Filter's sidechain controls via the toggle button in its title bar. Then enable the Sidechain button and select "Drums" from the top routing chooser. We're going to use the closed hihat to control the Auto Filter's /envelope follower,/ so select "Drums | CH | Pre FX" in the bottom chooser.

Now turn up Auto Filter's /Envelope/ knob to enable the envelope follower.
EnvelopeKnob.tif

Because our cutoff frequency is already quite high, it's difficult to hear what effect we've had so far. Gradually decrease Auto Filter's cutoff frequency by dragging its slider down.
Cutoff.tif

The filter's cutoff frequency now rises and falls along with the transients of the closed hihat. For an even more pronounced effect, try the settings below (or click $Link here <Set:/Sets/Compression and Sidechaining Auto Filter.als> to load our version):
-> Gain: 24 dB
-> Attack: .10 ms
-> Release: 1-10 ms
-> Cutoff: 450 Hz
-> Q: 1-1.5

$Page Where to Go from Here? 
$TargetName Where to Go from Here?

You've now learned a bit about compression in theory and practice, and gotten a chance to build various sidechaining routings for both mixing and creative sound design applications.

Here are some ideas for further experimentation and learning:

-> Go back through the examples in the Lesson and experiment with the other parameters in the selected effects. You'll find that subtle changes to the attack and release parameters, for example, can have a dramatic effect on the output.

-> In the sidechaining examples, experiment with changing the /Gain/ of the external sidechain source. It's important to note that this control doesn't effect the gain of the signal going to your speakers, but rather the signal level of the key that drives the effect.

-> Try experimenting with different key sources in the routing choosers when sidechaining. Switching from Pre to Post FX routing, for example, can make a big difference to how the sidechain behaves.

-> We also recommend reading the relevant $Link manual <Manual> sections on the Compressor, Auto Filter and Gate effects to learn more about how all of their parameters interact.
