$Page Setting Up Audio I/O 
$TargetName Setting Up Audio I/O
$Comment Windows Version

In this lesson, we'll set up and optimize $0's /audio I/O/ (its audio /input/ and /output/ capabilities). It will take us about ten minutes to configure everything, but this process only needs to be done once for each audio interface you use.

When we're finished, we'll have accomplished the following things:

-> Selecting a driver type;
-> Choosing input and output devices;
-> Configuring ins and outs;
-> Selecting the sampling rate;
-> Adjusting the audio I/O buffer size.


Please press the /Next Page/ button below to proceed.

$Page Opening the Audio Preferences 
$TargetName Opening the Audio Preferences

The audio I/O settings are found in $0's /Audio Preferences./ You can reach them by selecting the *Preferences...* entry from the /Options/ menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut *$CommandMod + ,* ($CommandMod + comma).
PrefsMenuPC.tif

When the Preferences window opens, select the /Audio/ tab.

$Page Selecting the Driver Type 
$TargetName Selecting the Driver Type

The /Audio Device/ settings refer to physical audio interfaces which are either built-in to your computer or connected to it externally. $0 communicates with audio devices through a piece of software known as a /driver./ In our first step, we'll use the /Driver Type/ chooser to tell $0 which driver to use.
DeviceTypeWindows.tif

$0 supports two types of Windows drivers:

-> *ASIO:*  This is the preferred choice for professional audio. If an ASIO driver is available in the Driver Type chooser, please select it (unless another entry better matches your configuration) and *skip* the discussion of MME/DirectX by clicking $Link here <GotoPage:Setting up Live for ASIO>. If no ASIO driver is available for the audio interface you are using (the built-in laptop audio interface, for instance), you might want to try installing an /ASIO wrapper/ like $Link ASIO4ALL <http://www.asio4all.com/>.

-> *MME/DirectX:*  This is the default driver type. Note that when using MME/DirectX, it is only possible to access one stereo input and one stereo output of your audio interface, even if the interface itself has multichannel capabilities. If you need to use an MME/DirectX driver, please press the /Next Page/ button below to continue.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Selecting the Audio Device 
$TargetName Selecting the Audio Device

Once you've selected a driver type, you'll be able to specify inputs and outputs using the /Audio Input Device/ and /Audio Output Device/ choosers:
InAndOutAudioDeviceChoosersDirectXMme.tif

The choices available to you here will depend upon your specific hardware and software setup. Most audio interfaces have both /DirectX/ and /MME/ options available, with DirectX usually being the better choice.

If you don't see your audio interface listed in these choosers, it probably requires a driver install before it can be recognized; check the manufacturer's documentation for details.


Divider.tif
*Note:* Though $0 allows selecting two different devices for input and output, we recommend selecting the same device for both in order to avoid problems.

$Page Configuring Ins and Outs 
$TargetName Configuring Ins and Outs

The /Input Config/ and /Output Config/ buttons determine which of the interface's inputs and outputs can be used by $0, and whether they can be accessed individually (mono), as stereo pairs, or both:
ChannelConfigButtons_Pc.tif

$If Product 01
Divider.tif
*Please note that there is a limit of four mono inputs and four mono outputs in Live LE.*
Divider.tif
$Endif

The buttons open a window with a pair of On/Off switches for each pair of input or output channels available:
InOutConfigurationExampleDirectXMme.tif

The right column of switches enables pairs of channels for stereo use, while the left column enables them for use as two independent mono channels.

Because MME/DirectX drivers only allow access to one I/O pair, it makes sense to leave both switches enabled so that you're free to choose the most appropriate configuration for any moment.

Click the /OK/ button once you've configured your I/O channels to return to the Audio Preferences.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Selecting the Sample Rate 
$TargetName Selecting the Sample Rate

The /In/Out Sample Rate/ setting determines the sampling rate at which $0 and your audio interface operate. On some audio devices, this rate may be fixed (usually at 44,100 Hz).
SampleRate.tif

Audio clips with different sample rates can be used together in $0, because $0 performs real-time sample-rate conversion. However, $0 will record all new audio clips at the sample rate chosen here.


Divider.tif
*Background Information:* The term "sample rate" refers to the number of samples per second that are used to represent a sound digitally. A digital representation of a sound is always more accurate at a higher sample rate. Unfortunately, high sample rates are CPU-intensive, since they require more calculations (there are more samples to process) per second of audio. The sample rate for CD-quality audio is 44,100 samples per second; this is usually a suitable Sample Rate setting.

$Page Using the Test Tone 
$TargetName Using the Test Tone

All audio passing through your computer is stored momentarily in /buffers/ - little sound reservoirs which keep the audio stream flowing when your CPU needs to pay attention to other tasks. Large buffers ensure an uninterrupted flow of audio at the expense of a "sluggish" response in the software. Small buffers provide a snappier response, but are more likely to "run dry," interrupting or mangling your sound.

The /Buffer Size/ settings let you define the optimal balance between responsiveness and stability. To find the correct value for your system, we'll have $0 simulate the kind of CPU-intensive situation that arises when many tracks, virtual instruments and effects are in use.

Locate the /Tone Volume/ parameter in the /Test/ section of $0's Audio Preferences, and lower it all the way to *-48 dB:*
ToneVolumeMin.tif

Set the /CPU Usage Simulator/ to the maximum value of *80%:*
CPUUsageSim.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adjusting the Output Buffer Size 
$TargetName Adjusting the Output Buffer Size

Activate the /Test Tone/ by clicking on its switch:
TestTone.tif

At this point, things might start to slow down, because the Test Tone also activates CPU Usage Simulator.

Raise Tone Volume slowly until you can hear the test tone clearly. Then, in the /Latency/ section, set the /Output Buffer Size/ control to its lowest value:
OutputBufferSizeControlDirectXMme.tif

You'll probably hear clicks or dropouts in the Test Tone's output. Slowly increase the buffer size until the clicks or dropouts stop. Find a value just high enough that the signal passes through undisturbed. Note that you can also use your keyboard's arrow keys to adjust the slider after selecting it with the mouse.

Once you've found a stable setting, you can turn the Test Tone switch off again.


Divider.tif
/Note:/ Hard drive activity can impose additional constraints on the minimum buffer size. If the sound breaks up while playing or recording multiple tracks of audio, you should probably choose a slightly higher buffer size.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adjusting the Input Buffer Size I 
$TargetName Adjusting the Input Buffer Size I

Our next goal will be to adjust the /Input Buffer Size./ To do this, we'll feed an external signal into $0 and find an Input Buffer Size setting just high enough to pass the signal through undisturbed.

Please create a new Live Set by choosing *New Live Set* from the /File/ menu. Note that you don't have to close the Preferences window to do this, but you will want to have clear access to the track *1 Audio:*
TrackOneInSessionMixer.tif

Now connect an external sound source, such as a microphone, CD player, or keyboard to the default inputs of your audio interface (usually inputs 1 and 2).

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adjusting the Input Buffer Size II 
$TargetName Adjusting the Input Buffer Size II

Engage the /Arm/ button which is found in the mixer section of *1 Audio* (If the Session Mixer isn't visible, you can enable it in the /View/ menu.):
TrackOneArmOn.tif

$0 is now passing the input signal through to this track's output. Feed a steady signal into $0; You should be able to hear any signal entering the audio interface, and the track's level meter should reflect the level of this signal.

While monitoring the input signal, set the Input Buffer Size to its lowest value:
InputBufferSizeControlDirectXMme.tif

You'll probably hear clicks or dropouts in the audio stream. Slowly increase the Input Buffer Size value until the input signal passes through undisturbed.

$0 is now configured to use your audio interface's MME/DirectX driver. The next pages cover ASIO settings which you can $Link skip for now <GotoPage:Related Settings>.

Now that you've selected *ASIO* from the Driver Type chooser, you'll be able to specify your audio interface in the /Audio Device/ chooser:

$TargetName Configuring Ins and Outs

The /Input Config/ and /Output Config/ buttons determine which of the interface's inputs and outputs can be used by $0, and whether they can be accessed individually (mono), as stereo pairs, or both:
InOutConfigurationButtons.tif

The buttons open a window with a pair of On/Off switches for each pair of input or output channels available:
InOutConfigurationExample.tif

The right column of switches enables pairs of channels for stereo use, while the left column enables them for use as two independent mono channels.

If inputs 1 and 2 are always connected to a turntable, for instance, you'll only need to access channels 1 and 2 in stereo. On the other hand, if inputs 1 and 2 are always connected to microphones, you'll only need the mono switch enabled.

You can also enable both switches so that you're free to choose the most appropriate configuration for any moment. This is useful for connections that change frequently. When working with the computer's built-in stereo hardware interface, for instance, you might record from a microphone in mono, then reconnect a few minutes later to record in stereo from a turntable.

Deactivate /both/ switches for any inputs or outputs which you don't use: Disabling unused channels optimizes CPU performance.

Click the /OK/ button once you've configured your I/O channels to return to the Audio Preferences.

$Page ASIO Hardware Setup 
$TargetName ASIO Hardware Setup

Clicking the /Hardware Setup/ button will open your audio interface's /ASIO control panel:/
AsioHardwareSetup.tif

The ASIO control panel is created by the manufacturer of your audio interface, and will therefore differ from device to device. In most cases it will feature a parameter called "Latency" or "Buffer Size," which we'll now find appropriate values for.


Divider.tif
/Note:/ The control panels of some ASIO devices are not accessible from within $0. Instead, they might only be accessible via a task bar icon or other application. To make things worse, some drivers won't allow $0 and the control panel to access the audio hardware at the same time. This means that to change a hardware setting, you will have to temporarily select *No Device* from the Audio Device chooser. Luckily, you won't have to do this frequently.

There's still one factor remaining to be tuned: /driver error compensation./
Latency.tif

This setting is only relevant for those of you who record audio into $0. We recommend that you first learn the basics by following the lesson $Link Recording Audio <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/2-Recording Audio>; then, if necessary, you can follow the $Link Driver Error Compensation <Lesson:Builtin/3-Hardware Setup Category/2-Driver Error Compensation> lesson to set this accurately.
