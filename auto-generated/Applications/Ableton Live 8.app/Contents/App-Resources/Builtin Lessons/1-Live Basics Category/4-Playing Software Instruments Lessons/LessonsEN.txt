$Page The Device Browser 
$TargetName The Device Browser

The instruments and effects in the Device Browser are grouped into categories using folders. To open and close a folder using your mouse, click on the small triangle to the left of its name:
DeviceBrowserTopLevel.tif

Whenever the Browser is focused, you can also use your computer keyboard's arrow keys for quick navigation:

-> The *up* and *down* arrow keys will move the selection up and down;
-> The *right* arrow key will open folders, and the *left* arrow key will close them.

Open the /Instruments/ folder to access $0's collection of built-in software instruments. The contents of this folder will vary depending upon which Ableton products you have enabled, but it will contain at least the following:
$If Product 20-3F, 03
-> /Impulse/
-> /Simpler/
-> /Instrument Rack/ and /Drum Rack/ folders:
ListOfInstrumentsLE.tif
$Else
-> /Impulse,/ /Simpler/ and the /External Instrument/ device
-> /Instrument Rack/ and /Drum Rack/ folders:

$Page Loading a Simpler Preset
$TargetName Loading a Simpler Preset

We're going to load a Simpler preset.

To get there, navigate to the Simpler icon and unfold it. Then open the "Piano and Keys" folder and select the "Keys-Acoustic Piano" preset:
SimplerPreset.tif

To load a preset, drag it to the right, holding it over the Arrangement track *2 MIDI.* The mouse cursor will change to indicate that the preset can be dropped into this track:
DragPreset.tif

After releasing the mouse button, you'll see the new preset appear in the /Track View/ at the bottom of the application window:
PresetInTrackView.tif

$TargetName Playing the Instrument via MIDI

In order to play the software instrument, we first need to make sure that its track is /armed./ This normally happens automatically when an instrument is inserted, but you can do it manually by clicking on the track's /Arm/ button in the track mixer:
ArmButtonInst.tif

Arming the track accomplishes two things:

-> It allows the track to receive MIDI notes from an external MIDI keyboard (or, in the absence of an external device, your computer keyboard, as we'll see in a moment).
-> It record-enables the track, allowing you to record what you play at any time;

If you have a MIDI keyboard connected to your computer, then go ahead and play a few notes now. You should hear the instrument as you play, and this should be reflected by the /input/ and /output meters/ which enclose the instrument in the Track View:
TrackViewMeters.tif


Divider.tif
*Troubleshooting:* If notes played on the keyboard don't seem to arrive in $0, then please follow the lesson $Link Connecting MIDI Controllers <Lesson:Builtin/3-Hardware Setup Category/3-Connecting MIDI Controllers>.

$Page Using the Computer Keyboard 
$TargetName Using the Computer Keyboard

If you don't have a MIDI keyboard available, you can use your computer's keyboard instead. To do this, make sure that the /Computer MIDI Keyboard/ switch at the upper-right corner of the screen is enabled:
ComputerKeyboardSwitchInst.tif

-> The letter keys in the upper row of the keyboard (QWER...) will play the black piano keys;
-> Those in the center row (ASDF...) will play the white keys;
-> The *Z* and *X* keys will transpose the range of the computer MIDI keyboard;
-> The *C* and *V* keys will change the velocity, or intensity, of the notes that you play.

The /Status Bar/ at the bottom of the application window will provide feedback when pressing the transpose or velocity keys:
StatusBarOctave.tif


Divider.tif
*Note:* The keys of your computer keyboard can also be mapped to arbitrary controls in $0, as described in the Reference Manual's "MIDI and Key Remote Control" section.

Keep in mind that all I/O from your computer's keyboard is mediated by the computer's operating system, not $0. Because of this, the computer MIDI keyboard is best suited for auditioning sounds; an external keyboard or control surface should be used whenever more precise tactile input is needed.

$Page Saving Presets 
$TargetName Saving Presets

Perhaps you've adjusted Simpler's parameters and created a sound that you want to save for later? You can save the instrument's current settings at any time by clicking the /Save Preset/ button in the device's title bar:
PresetSaveButtonInst.tif

The new preset will appear in the Device Browser next to the original, highlighted and ready to be renamed:
NewPresetInst.tif

Your self-made preset will now be accessible through the Device Browser and can be loaded into your other Live Sets.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Hot-Swapping Presets 
$TargetName Hot-Swapping Presets

$0's Library provides a great diversity of sounds, so whenever you feel like exploring another preset, simply click on the /Hot-Swap/ button in the device's title bar:
BrowseButtonInst.tif

The preset last chosen will appear highlighted in the Browser, this time with a matching Hot-Swap button to its right:
BrowseButtonTwinInst.tif

By pressing the Hot-Swap button, we have created a temporary link between the Browser and the device in the Track View. Selecting a preset then hitting the *Enter/Return* key on your keyboard will replace the previously loaded instrument with the new preset; if the preset belongs to another instrument, like /Impulse,/ $0 will even exchange the device for you!

Once you've found an instrument which suits you, you can press your computer keyboard's *Esc* key to exit Hot-Swap mode.

The $0 Browser also offers a convenient search function that will find presets by keyword. For example, click on the /Browser Search/ button, then type in "bass" and hit the *Return* key to list all bass presets in $0's Library:
BrowserSearchButton.tif

$Page Using External Plug-Ins 
$TargetName Using External Plug-Ins

$0's built-in instruments and effects can be complemented by third-party plug-ins in VST or Audio Units (Mac only) formats. Using plug-ins is very similar to using the built-in devices. To insert a plug-in instrument, first open the /Plug-In Browser/ using this selector:
PluginBrowserSelector.tif

*Note:* You might have to activate $0's plug-in support if you are using plug-ins for the first time. The Plug-in Browser's /Activate/ button will lead you to the File/Folder Preferences, where you can set up your plug-ins.

Any plug-ins that you have will be listed in the Browser, organized first by format, then by creator. Instrument plug-ins can be differentiated from effect plug-ins by the tiny /piano keys/ that occupy the lower half of their Browser icon:
PluginBrowserInst.tif

Just as with $0's devices, select an instrument and drag it into a MIDI track. The plug-in's /custom editor window/ will open automatically. In the Track View, plug-in devices are shown with an assignable /X-Y grid:/
PlugInTrackView.tif

$Page The Metronome 
$TargetName The Metronome

Before we finish this lesson, let's take a quick look at how to record your performance into the /Arrangement,/ which is $0's multitrack tape recorder.

It is important to record in sync to ensure that everything will later play in sync. The easiest way to record in sync is to use the built-in /metronome,/ which is activated via its Control Bar switch. You'll find it in the upper-left corner of the application window:
MetronomeSwitch.tif

The metronome ticks when $0 is playing. Press the *space bar* to start playback, then adjust the metronome's volume using the Master track's /Cue Volume/ control:
CueVolume.tif

Press the *space bar* again to stop.

$Page Recording and Playback 
$TargetName Recording and Playback

Our next steps will start the recording process. Our MIDI track is already record-enabled - we activated its Arm button earlier so that $0 would respond to MIDI notes:
ArrangerTracksInst.tif

Press the Control Bar's /Stop/ button twice to reset the Arrangement position to *1.1.1:*
TransportStopRec.tif

Now press the adjacent /Global Record/ button (This is probably familiar to those of you who have used multitrack tape machines: Individual tracks can be armed for recording, then the Global Record button enables recording for those armed tracks.):
GlobalRecordRec.tif

Finally, press the Control Bar's /Play/ button (or use the *space bar* on your computer's keyboard) to begin recording:
TransportPlayRec.tif

As recording progresses, you'll see a new /MIDI clip/ being created in the track:
ArrangementMIDIClipRecording.tif

To stop recording, press the Stop button. Press it a second time to reset the Arrangement to *1.1.1,* then listen to your performance by pressing the Play button.


Divider.tif
*Hint:* To scroll the view backward or forward, or to zoom in or out, grab the /beat-time ruler/ along the top of the Arrangement with the mouse and drag left, right, up or down.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Looking Inside the Clip 
$TargetName Looking Inside the Clip

There are lots of things you can do with your newly recorded clip.

/Arrange/ the clip with respect to others in a song: You can grab clips by their title bars to move them to different positions, drag their sides to change their length and more.
ClipTitleBarInst.tif

/Edit/ the clip's contents and settings: To see the contents of your new clip, double-click its title bar - the MIDI notes contained within the clip will appear in the /Clip View/ at the bottom of the application window.
MIDIEditorInst.tif

To toggle between the Track View, where the instrument and the effects reside, and the Clip View, which shows the MIDI clip's details, either hold *$ShiftMod* then press *Tab,* or click on one of the corresponding overviews at the bottom of the application window:
DetailOverviewsInst.tif


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Editing Notes 
$TargetName Editing Notes

The MIDI Editor has its own beat-time ruler, which can be used for zooming and scrolling horizontally, just like in the Arrangement. You can also click and drag on the area to the left of the piano keys to zoom and scroll the editor vertically:
MIDIEditorScrollAreas.tif

If you disable the /Draw Mode/ switch in the Control Bar, you can select and move notes using your mouse. Move groups of notes by dragging a selection box around them:
DrawModeOffInst.tif

Each note has its own /velocity/ marker at the bottom of the MIDI Editor. This marker denotes /note velocity/ - the intensity with which it is played. Velocities can also be changed by clicking and dragging:
VelocityEditorInst.tif
