$TargetName DJing with Live
Ableton Live has established itself as an ideal platform for creating, producing and performing original music. But Live is also enormously popular among DJs because it makes the transition between DJing, remixing and production seamless and natural.

Live allows DJs to:
-> combine many tracks simultaneously
-> remix and edit tracks on the fly
-> choose from a large selection of pre-made audio effects and Racks
-> record a performance and edit every parameter afterwards

In this lesson, you'll learn how to /warp/ a full track, how to split a track into separate clips and how to work with Live's audio effects.

$TargetName What's Happening in This Set?

The Set contains three audio tracks, and each track contains a number of clips.

Click on the /Clip Launch buttons/ of any of these clips to hear them play back.
ClipLaunchButtons.tif

By default, all clips start only on the next downbeat after they're triggered. And although some of these clips are at different tempos, Live keeps them all synchronized.

Only one clip can play on a track at a time, but clips on different tracks can play simultaneously. This allows you to easily combine loops and sections from multiple songs.

$Page Clip View at a Glance
$TargetName Clip View at a Glance

The clips on the first track are all at 128 BPM, while the clips on the second track are at 126 BPM. Live automatically keeps all clips synchronized, regardless of their original tempos.

Double-click on any clip to open it in the /Clip View/ at the bottom of the screen:
ClipView.tif

The original tempo of the clip is displayed in the Clip View field labeled "Seg. BPM," shown below.
OrigBpm.tif

*The Clip View contains all the information and settings for any given clip. You can learn more in the "Clip View" chapter of the reference manual, which can be opened from the * /Help/ *menu.*
Divider.tif

Now, create a little more screen space for the Clip View by hiding the Info View. To do this, please press the triangular button at the lower left corner of the screen.

$Page Changing Tempo and Re-Pitching
$TargetName Changing Tempo and Re-Pitching

All of our clips have been /warped/ to fit the project tempo, which is 126 BPM.

You can see this by looking at the /Tempo control/ in the upper left corner of the screen:
Tempo.tif

Click and drag up and down on the Tempo control to change the project tempo. Notice that all clips stay in sync with your changes.

As you change the tempo, the loops will not change in terms of pitch: /In $0, pitch is controlled separately from tempo,/ so that you can easily beat-match various styles of music without ever affecting pitch.

On the other hand, you may /want/ the pitch to change, so that the loops respond more like a record on a turntable. Try changing any clip's /Warp Mode/ to Re-Pitch in the Clip View, like this:
$If Product 20-3F, 03
WarpModeRepitchLE.tif
$Else
WarpModeRepitch.tif
$Endif

Now, as you change the project tempo, $0 will pitch the clip up or down to follow your changes, just as a turntable or classic sampler would.

$Page Warping Basics
$TargetName Warping Basics

In order to keep everything in sync, Live uses /warp markers/ to define the tempo of each clip.

Warp markers act like "pins" that fix a particular point in the music to a particular position in time.

The clips in this Set have already had their warp markers adjusted as necessary. In fact, Live usually takes care of this automatically when you load new audio.

Sometimes, however, Live might make a mistake about the tempo of a new sample. Or it might start playing the clip back somewhere other than where you expect. In these cases, you can adjust the warp markers and playback properties yourself.

To try this, start by opening $Link this folder <BrowseLibraryFiles:/Lessons/Samples/> in Live's Browser and navigating to the file called "jeff_samuel_template.aif."
NewTrack.tif

Drag this file into the area that says "Drop Files and Devices Here," or to the right of the 3rd audio track. As you hover over this area, you'll see an outline of a new clip appear. When you drop the file, a new audio track will be created containing the clip.
NewClipInTrack.tif

Press the /Stop All Clips/ button to stop any clips that are already playing.
StopClips.tif

Now press the Clip Launch button on the new clip.

$Page Warping a Full Track
$TargetName Warping a Full Track

You can hear that Live seems to have analyzed the clip's tempo correctly. But if you now enable the metronome, you'll hear that it's playing a half-beat off.
Metronome.tif

This usually happens if there's some silence at the beginning of the clip or if Live thinks the downbeat is in some unusual place.

To check this, double-click the clip to show it in Clip View. Now hold your mouse pointer near the top left of the sample display area until it becomes a magnifying glass:
Zoom.tif

Now click and drag down until you've zoomed into you can clearly see the beginning of the sample:
ZoomedClipStart.tif

As you can see, Live starts playing this clip about one eighth-note before the audio actually starts. To fix it, place the pointer on the grey /transient marker/ at the beginning of the audio:
FirstTransient.tif

Now $ContextMenu to open the context menu and select *Set 1.1.1 Here* to begin playback from this point. Then $ContextMenu to open the context menu again and select *Warp from here (straight).* The context menu's "Warp from here..." options each yield slightly different results, but this one will usually give the best results for this type of electronic music.

Finally, relaunch the clip. You'll hear that it's now beatmatched perfectly with the metronome (and thus with the other clips in the Set.)

(For more information about Live's warping, see the "Tempo Control and Warping" chapter in the $Link Ableton Reference Manual <Manual>.)

$TargetName Organizing Your DJ Set

In order to perform an interesting mix, it helps to be able to create new variations of the songs in your collection.

To do this, we've duplicated each clip a few times with each clip playing a different section. This allows us to create loops containing breakdowns, kick-only passages, etc.

Try this yourself with the new clip you've dragged in. First, select it. Then run the *Duplicate* command from the *Edit* menu a few times to create three or four copies.
FourDuplicates.tif

Now select one of the copies, enable /Loop,/ and choose a common loop length such as 2, 4 or 8 bars:
LoopSettings.tif

Now try adjusting the /Start/ and /Loop Position/ markers to find interesting loops within the song:
StartLoopPosition.tif

$Page The Crossfader
$TargetName The Crossfader

Now, let's see how to use $0's /crossfader/ for blending tracks.

This button shows or hides the crossfader section of $0's mixer:
CrossfaderShow.tif

If the crossfader isn't already on screen, please press this button once to show it now.

Live's crossfader works a bit differently than the crossfader on a standard DJ mixer. Tracks are assigned to the crossfader using the buttons labeled "A" and "B" just beneath their mixer controls:
CrossfadeAssign.tif

If the "A" or "B" buttons are assigned in a track, the track's volume will be controlled by the crossfader. No assignment means that the track will play all the time.

There is no limit to the number of tracks you can assign, meaning that you can blend /as many tracks as you like/ using the crossfader.

Notice that the crossfader is currently in the center position:
CrossfaderMiddle.tif

Move the crossfader slowly to the right to hear the B tracks gradually take over and the A tracks fade out. Our new track is currently unassigned, so it is heard regardless of the crossfader's position.

$Page Hands-On Control
$TargetName Hands-On Control

Since nearly every function in $0 can be assigned to a MIDI controller, you might have more fun controlling $0's crossfader with an external device.

If you don't have a MIDI controller set up in $0 at the moment, please skip this step.

If you do have a MIDI controller set up, enter /MIDI Map Mode/ by pressing the "MIDI" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
MidiMapButton.tif

Click near the middle of the crossfader to select it for mapping, as shown below.
SelectedCrossfader.tif

Now, when you turn a knob or push a slider on your physical device, the assignment will be displayed on the crossfader. While in MIDI Map Mode, you can make as many assignments as you like to various controls in the interface.

Press the "MIDI" button again to exit MIDI Map Mode and activate the assignments.

Before moving on, return the crossfader to the center position so we can hear all of our tracks.

Divider.tif
*You can set $0 up to recognize an external MIDI device in the MIDI/Sync Preferences. For more on external MIDI devices and $0, please see the $Link lesson about control surfaces <Lesson:Builtin/3-Hardware Setup Category/3-Connecting MIDI Controllers>.*

$Page EQ Three
$TargetName EQ Three

$0 comes with a great selection of built-in effects, one of which is the DJ-style /EQ Three:/
EQ3.tif

Let's insert an EQ Three into the first track in this Set. First, click the button to open Live's /Device Browser/ and navigate to the /Audio Effects/ folder:
DeviceBrowser.tif

Unfold this folder, drag the EQ Three device and drop it anywhere on the first track.

The device will appear at the bottom of the screen in the /Track View./

EQ Three features knobs and kill switches for filtering the low, high and mid-range frequency bands in your music.

To hear it in action, make sure one of this track's clips is playing. It might help to /Solo/ the track:
Solo.tif

Now try out the kill switches...
KillSwitches.tif

... and the gain knobs.
GainKnobs.tif

In this Lesson, you've seen a simple example of how Live can function like a self-contained collection of familiar DJ tools. You can expand on this example in many new and creative directions. We also recommend going through the rest of the Live Lessons.

-> Click $Link here <Lesson:Internal/BuiltinAutoToc> to access all of the installed Lessons.

-> /Using effects/ - In addition to the EQ Three used in this lesson, $0 offers a broad range of audio effects that excel at manipulating audio in real time. $0's /Beat Repeat/ effect, for example, processes loops in incredible ways. $0's effects and instruments are described in detail in the $Link Ableton Reference Manual <Manual>.

-> /Mixing your own music/ - The same warping and processing used on the music in this Lesson can, of course, be used on songs from your own collection. Live can work with tracks in a variety of audio formats, including mp3, FLAC and Ogg Vorbis.
