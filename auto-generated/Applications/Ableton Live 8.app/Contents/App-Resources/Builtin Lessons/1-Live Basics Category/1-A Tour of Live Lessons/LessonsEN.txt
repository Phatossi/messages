This lesson is intended to help you get started with the program. Rather than covering $0's feature set in its entirety, we will introduce some basic terms and walk you through $0's working environment.

A complete introduction to the concepts behind $0 is provided by the reference manual's "Live Concepts" chapter. The reference manual is accessible via the /Help/ menu.

For the purposes of this tutorial, please complete the steps as described first before otherwise changing any settings. 

If something unexpected happens, don't worry, as you can always choose /Undo/ from the /Edit/ Menu or use the $CommandMod-Z shortcut. If you get lost along the way, simply reload the lesson and start again.

This lesson has also been made into a movie. Click $Link here <http://www.ableton.com/_common/downloads/movies/tour_of_live.mov> to launch the movie from the Ableton website.

*$0's documents are known as Live Sets. This lesson is accompanied by a Live Set which you'll be interacting with as you follow the lesson. Whenever you're ready, please click $Link here <Set:/Sets/Tour of Live Demo.als> to load the Live Set.*

$Page Playing the Demo Arrangement 
$TargetName Playing the Demo Arrangement

Shown here is $0's /Arrangement View./ 
Arrangement.tif

The Arrangement View is $0's multitrack recording and editing environment. If you've used any other multitrack recording software before, this view probably looks very familiar - time is represented horizontally, while tracks are stacked vertically.

To listen to the Arrangement, please press your computer keyboard's space bar. /You can always use the space bar to toggle play and stop./

Listen to the song long enough, and the Arrangement will start to scroll. To move the view backward or forward, or to zoom in/out, grab the /beat-time ruler/ with the mouse, and drag left, right, up or down.
BeatTimeRuler.tif

Vertical mouse movements in the Arrangement View zoom in and out; horizontal movements scroll left and right. /This works on any beat-time ruler in any of $0's views./


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page The Session View 
$TargetName The Session View

In addition to the familiar timeline view in the Arrangement, $0 offers another way of working, known as /Session View./ This is shown below:
Session.tif

To switch back and forth between the Session and the Arrangement, press the Tab key on your computer keyboard.

The Session View offers an improvisational approach to music-making, allowing you to record, play and combine ideas /on the fly./ This tool is equally useful for songwriting, jamming (alone or with other musicians) and DJing. Your transitions always remain locked to musical time, even during tempo and groove changes.

Let us next look at how music is organized in the Session View.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Scenes 
$TargetName Scenes

The Session View's horizontal rows are called /scenes./  In this setup, every scene represents a song section, such as the intro, a verse, a chorus, etc.

Please click on the triangular /Scene Launch Button/ on the right-hand side of the top scene, as shown below.
SceneLaunchButton.tif

The "A" scene will begin to play:
SessionViewScene.tif

This will keep playing until you launch another scene. Please try launching the "B" and "B2" scenes to move through the song sections, or rearrange the song parts on the fly by launching scenes in any other order.

Divider.tif
*Unlike a linearly arranged song, each section can play for as long as you like and in any order.*


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Playing Clips 
$TargetName Playing Clips

Each scene is made up of smaller parts, called /clips./  Clips are simply containers for audio or MIDI data, and allow you to take nonlinear composition one step further by deviating from scenes and trying variations. For example, first launch scene "A" once more:
ASceneAgain.tif

Let us try to combine a bass line from another song part with the "A" clips. Click on the /Clip Launch button/ of the "Bass" clip in the "B" scene, as shown:
ClipVariationOnScene.tif

Now, you can try combining different clips from different song parts. Any clip or scene you launch will stay in sync with the tempo of the Set. And by default, all clips start only on the next downbeat after they're triggered.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Stopping Clips 
$TargetName Stopping Clips

Notice that launching a clip stops playback of the clip that was previously playing in the same column. The vertical columns in the Session View represent /tracks,/ and a track can only play one clip at a time. Therefore, one typically puts variations of a clip in the same track.

If you want to stop a clip without causing another one to start, you can use any /Clip Stop/ button from the same track. These square buttons appear by default in all empty Clip Slots:
ClipStopButtonsInTracks.tif

There are some cases, though - like in the "Pad," "ShortBright," and "Warm EP" tracks - where there are empty Clip Slots without stop buttons. Rest assured, there is always a Clip Stop button at the bottom of every track, just above the Session Mixer:
ClipStopButton.tif

Divider.tif
Clips are the basic musical building blocks in $0. Now that we know how to launch them and stop them, it's time to see what they're made of.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Peeking Into an Audio Clip 
$TargetName Peeking Into an Audio Clip

In scene "A" please double-click on the "ShortBright A" clip's name (but not on its Clip Launch button):
ShortBrightClip.tif

The clip's contents are now displayed in Live's /Clip View:/
AudioInClipView.tif

"ShortBright A" is an /audio clip./ Audio clips play sound which has been saved in a /sample file./ $0 offers lots of interesting options for manipulating samples while they play.

As an example, let's see how easy it is to transpose this clip down by a fifth.

A clip's /sample box/ features several controls which affect the playback of the clip's sample. While the clip is playing, click once on the /Transpose/ knob and type "-7", then hit the Enter/Return key on your computer keyboard:
ChangingTranspose.tif

Notice that the tempo of the clip doesn't change as we transpose it. $0 treats audio with the same kind of flexibility as MIDI data, allowing you real-time, independent control of pitch and tempo for every clip in your Set.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Peeking Into a MIDI Clip 
$TargetName Peeking Into a MIDI Clip

Now, click on the "Drums A" clip from the "A" scene:
DrumsMIDIClip.tif

Again, the clip's contents are shown in the Clip View:
DrumsInClipView.tif

The drum clip is a /MIDI clip./ It doesn't produce any sounds of its own, but instead contains /MIDI notes/ which tell a software instrument what to play. To see the instrument on this track, press Shift-Tab to switch to /Track View:/
TrackView.tif

This track contains two of $0's built-in devices: a /Drum Rack/ instrument and a /Beat Repeat/ effect. The Drum Rack provides a familiar pad layout for our percussion samples, while the Beat Repeat effect adds variety to our groove by creating semi-random variations of the Drum Rack's audio output.

We can toggle back and forth between Track View and Clip View at any time by pressing Shift-Tab again.

For more information about using software instruments, see the $Link "Playing Software Instruments" <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/4-Playing Software Instruments> lesson.

$Page From Sketch to Composition 
$TargetName From Sketch to Composition

You've now had an introduction to $0's Session and Arrangement views, and have a sense of how clips and tracks work. Now let's look at how a Session View jam naturally evolves into a finished composition by recording your actions into a new Arrangement.

Divider.tif
*First, let's load a different Set by clicking $Link here <Set:/Sets/Tour of Live Demo Empty.als>. Click "No" when Live asks you if you would like to save your changes.*
Divider.tif

The new Set contains exactly the same Session View material but contains nothing in the Arrangement; we're going to make our own.

First, stop playback for all clips in the Session View by pressing the /Stop All Clips button:/
StopAllClips.tif

Then, reset the Arrangement position to 1.1.1 by pressing the Control Bar's /Stop button/ twice.
StopButton.tif

Press the Control Bar's /Record button./
RecordButton.tif

Recording will now begin when any clip or scene is launched. $0 will keep a precise log of each clip and scene launched, every mixer and effect control changed, and even changes to tempo.

Click the Stop button whenever you are done.


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Your Arrangement 
$TargetName Your Arrangement

Press the Tab key on your computer keyboard to switch to $0's Arrangement View, where we began this lesson.

You can see your recording here, laid out as an arrangement of horizontal clips. Reset the Arrangement position to 1.1.1 again, then hit the space bar to have $0 play back your performance.
ArrangementWithAutomation.tif

$Page Where to Go from Here? 
$TargetName Where to Go from Here?

$0 builds bridges from improvisation to composition- and back. It certainly pays to understand the underlying concepts, as laid out in the reference manual's "Live Concepts" chapter. Also, we recommend going through the rest of the Lessons.

Here are some ideas for further experimentation and learning:

-> Click $Link here <Lesson:Internal/BuiltinAutoToc> to access all of the installed Lessons.

-> Trying loading some other clips, either from your own sample collection or from Live's Library content that was installed with the program. Of course, you can also record your own $Link audio <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/2-Recording Audio> or $Link MIDI <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/3-Creating Beats> clips as well.

$If Product 00
-> Every sound in this demo was made with presets and instruments from *Ableton Suite.* If you own Suite, you can $Link load an all-MIDI version of the Demo Set <Set:/Sets/Tour of Live Suite Demo.als> as well. *Please note that the Suite Demo requires much more CPU power than the audio version.*
