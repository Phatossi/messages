One of the most powerful features of $0's Racks is the set of /Macro Controls./ Each Rack includes eight knobs which are fully user-definable; each knob can control any number of parameters in any of the devices within the Rack - simultaneously. Furthermore, each of these assignments can have its own range and polarity. And of course, each Macro knob can be further controlled by a hardware MIDI controller, for additional performance flexibility.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create and modify these Macro Control assignments, as well as how to control them via MIDI.

This set contains one track, called *Synth,* which contains a fairly simple two-chain Rack. If you haven't already done the $Link Building Layered Instruments <Lesson:Builtin/9-Device Racks Category/1-Building Layered Instruments> lesson, we suggest you start there to get familiar with the basics of creating and using Racks.

$Page Map Mode
$TargetName Map Mode

With the Macro Controls window open, you can view our eight knobs.
MacroKnobs.tif

They're not currently assigned, so although you can turn them like any other knobs in $0, they won't affect anything yet. To configure them, click the /Map Mode/ button.
MacroMapButton.tif

When you enter Map Mode, several things happen:
-> If the Browser is open, it becomes the /Mapping Browser./ Once you've defined some Macro mappings, you can edit them here.
MacroBrowser.tif

-> Every parameter in the Rack that can be assigned to a Macro Control becomes highlighted. This includes almost all of the parameters of any devices in the Rack, as well as the /Chain Volume,/ /Pan/ and /Activator/ controls in both the /Chain List/ and the Session Mixer.
-> The area under each Macro knob becomes a button called /Map./

$Page Assigning Macro Controls
$TargetName Assigning Macro Controls

To assign a parameter to a Macro knob, you must first make sure you're looking at the correct device chain. Do this now by first clicking in the "Air" chain to select it.
AirChain.tif

Then click the /Freq/ knob in the chain's /Simpler/ instrument to prepare its Filter Cutoff Frequency for assigning.
FreqKnob.tif

Notice that the Map buttons become enabled as soon as you click a parameter. To finish the mapping, click the Map button under the knob labeled /Macro 1./

Once you've actually made an assignment, several more things happen:
-> We can now see (and edit) the details of the mapping in the Mapping Browser.
MappingEntry.tif

-> The assigned parameter appears with a colored square in its upper-left corner, as well as a text field that shows the name of the Macro control to which it has been mapped.
AssignedKnob.tif

-> The mapped Macro has now taken the name of the mapped parameter, as well as its units.
MacroNameUnits.tif

-> The button under the Filter Freq Macro now reads /Unmap./ You could click this to delete the filter cutoff assignment. You can also delete assignments via their entries in the Mapping Browser, or assign/delete assignments directly from the parameter via *$ContextMenu.*
MappingContext.tif

$Page Multiple Macro Assignments
$TargetName Multiple Macro Assignments

Let's assign the filter resonance to the same Macro control. To do this, click the /Res/ knob to select it, then click the first Macro's Map button to complete the assignment.
ResKnob.tif

Since you've assigned the same Macro to multiple parameters, the knob's name goes back to the generic name "Macro 1." Let's rename it to something more memorable - like "Filter." To rename a Macro control, either *$ContextMenu* over it, or click it and *$CommandMod-R* to invoke the Rename command. Notice that the name immediately updates in the text field for both of our assigned parameters and in the Mapping Browser. This makes it easy to keep track of what's assigned to what.

So far, you've assigned two parameters from the same device to one Macro control. But Macro controls can be assigned to multiple devices as well, as long as they're contained within the same Rack. To assign the filter parameters for the device in the "Wood" chain, simply click its entry in the chain list to select it:
WoodChain.tif

Then map its Freq and Res knobs to the Filter Macro, just as you did for the Simpler in the "Air" chain.

When you're done, you should have four entries in the Mapping Browser.
FourAssignments.tif

$Page The Mapping Browser
$TargetName The Mapping Browser

The Mapping Browser allows you to see all of the settings of your mapping assignments in one place, and to adjust their ranges if necessary. By default, the browser shows the following columns:

-> *Macro* - the name of each assigned Macro knob
-> *Path* - the name of the chain, followed by the name of the assigned device in that chain
-> *Name* - the name of the assigned parameter
-> *Min* - the value of the parameter when the Macro is turned fully counter-clockwise
-> *Max* - the value of the parameter when the Macro is turned fully clockwise

If we *$ContextMenu* in the header area of the Browser, you can show or hide any of these columns.
BrowserContext.tif

When dealing with large numbers of mappings, it may be helpful to focus only on certain criteria - e.g., all parameters assigned to Macro 1, or all parameters in a particular device. To help with this, you can sort in the Mapping Browser by Macro, Path, or Name by clicking in the header area.
SortingTriangle.tif

$Page Editing Macro Mappings
$TargetName Editing Macro Mappings

Editing the Min and Max fields in the Mapping Browser allows you to constrain (or even invert) the range of values that will be passed to any mapped parameter from the Macro knobs. For example, to limit the minimum value of the "Air" cutoff to 150 Hz, simply select its entry in the mapping browser:
AirFilterSelect.tif

then click in its Min field and type *150.*
TypedMinValue.tif

Like all other numerical fields in $0, these text areas are also sliders; you can drag with the mouse to set values as well.

Now when you turn the Macro knob, you can see that you have modified only this one value; the other assigned parameters are unaffected.

Let's also constrain the Max value of this filter's Res control to *4,* to limit the harsh peaks caused by extremely high resonance settings. Your "Air" filter fields should now look like this:
AirFilterSettings.tif

Because Min and Max fields in the Mapping Browser can be independently set across the full range of a parameter's possible values, creating /inverted/ mapping assignments is easy; simply set the Min value /higher/ than the corresponding Max value. An even easier method is to use the *Invert Range* command, invoked via *$ContextMenu* on a Mapping Browser entry. This immediately swaps the Min and Max values. Let's try this now with the "Air" Filter Freq assignment.
InvertRange.tif

Now, turning the Filter Macro clockwise will lower the filter cutoff while raising the resonance.

Divider.tif
If your MIDI keyboard does not include knobs and/or faders, you will need to configure another control surface for this part of the lesson. Please see the $Link Connecting MIDI Controllers <Lesson:Builtin/3-Hardware Setup Category/3-Connecting MIDI Controllers> lesson for help with configuration.
Divider.tif

For even more flexibility, you can assign MIDI knobs and faders to control the Macro knobs. Creating these MIDI assignments works the same way as all other MIDI assignments in $0. First, click the *MIDI Map Mode Switch* (or press *$CommandMod-M).*
MIDIMapButton.tif

Then click the Filter Macro to select it for MIDI mapping.
MIDIKnob.tif

Then move the hardware knob/fader that you want to assign. Exit MIDI mapping mode to use your new controller assignment.

*Note* - When in MIDI mapping mode, the Mapping Browser shows MIDI Mapping assignments (as opposed to Macro assignments). The MIDI and Macro Browsers share much of the same functionality, including the ability to constrain and invert Min and Max assignment ranges. Inverting a MIDI assignment has the same behavior as inverting a Macro assignment.

But if you invert a MIDI assignment of a Macro that /already/ has an inverted mapping to a particular parameter, the MIDI control of that parameter will behave as if it was not inverted. This sort of scenario carries a high risk of headache. The moral of the story is that it's easy to lose track of your mapping assignments; with great power comes great responsibility.

-> You now know how to assign Macro controls to one or more parameters within a Rack. By carefully setting up your Macro controls when you design your Racks, you can hide a complex instrument or effects structure behind an easy-to-modify control interface. Experiment with adding and modifying additional Macro assignments to get more practice with the workflow.

-> Try assigning a Macro control to the /Chain Volume/ sliders. By inverting one of the assignments, you can create a chain crossfader.

-> For radical sound design experiments, try assigning Macro controls to completely unrelated parameters within a single device. For example, one Macro controlling LFO Frequency, Filter type, and Transposition can wreak havoc on your patch - especially when you start manipulating Min and Max values.
