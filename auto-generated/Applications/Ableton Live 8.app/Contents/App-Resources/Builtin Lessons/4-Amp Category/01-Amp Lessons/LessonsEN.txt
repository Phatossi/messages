/Welcome to Amp!/

*Amp* is an Ableton audio effect that delivers warmth and drive without hassles. Co-developed with Softube, Amp accurately delivers the sound and simplicity of legendary amplifiers and cabinets.

Amp comes with *Cabinet,* a separate effect that provides a selection of classic guitar cabs, with optimized mics and mic positioning. We've also included a wide range of sounds that transform Ableton's instruments and effects with Amp's new sonic character. These include Instrument and Effect Racks, Live Clips and over 400 presets.

There are seven amp models to choose from:

-> *Clean* is based on the "Brilliant" channel of a classic amp from the '60s. This amp was widely used by guitarists of the British Invasion.

-> *Boost* is based on the "Tremolo" channel of the same amp, and is great for edgy rock riffs.

-> *Blues* is based on a '70s-era guitar amp with a bright character. This classic amp is popular with country, rock and blues guitarists.

-> *Rock* is modeled after a classic 45 watt amp from the '60s. This is perhaps the best known rock amp of all time.

-> *Lead* is based on the "Modern" channel of a high-gain amp popular with metal guitarists.

-> *Heavy* is based on the "Vintage" channel of the same amp and is also ideal for metal and grunge sounds.

-> *Bass* is modeled after a rare PA from the '70s which has become popular with bass players due to its strong low end and "fuzz" at high volumes.
