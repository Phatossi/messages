For the final in this series of lessons, we're going to use all of the skills we've learned so far, and then some! This lesson will focus on Operator's unique ability to loop its envelopes, creating intricate rhythmic textures that are difficult, if not impossible, to create on other synths.

If you haven't already completed the previous lessons, it may be a good idea to review them before proceeding so that you are familiar with the concepts discussed here.

As with the other Operator lessons, you will want to get a better view of the instrument in the /Track View,/ folding away the /Info View/ by clicking its Show/Hide button at the lower left corner of the screen.

Let's configure our oscillator routing.

Make Operator's global section available in the display by clicking on it in the shell.
GlobalSection.tif
Then select the algorithm with two stacked pairs of oscillators, shown below.
Algorithm.tif

This algorithm will allow us to get the best of both FM and analog-style synthesis.

Set Oscillator A's /Level/ to -3.5 dB, but leave the tuning parameters at their default values.

$TargetName Using Envelopes to Add Rhythm

Now, let's start adding some rhythm to the patch.

Soften the /Attack/ of Oscillator A's envelope slightly by changing its value to 0.38 ms, and then increase the /Decay/ to 9.90 seconds and decrease the /Sustain/ to -inf dB:
RhythmAtkDec.tif

In the envelope's Mode section, switch the /Loop/ type to Sync:
RhythmEnvLoop.tif

Now, set a /Repeat/ value of 1/4:
RhythmRepeat.tif

This will make the volume of Oscillator A's sine wave pulse in quarter notes.

$Page Adding FM Modulation 
$TargetName Adding FM Modulation

Switch to Oscillator B, which is set up to modulate Oscillator A via FM. Leave its tuning controls at their default settings, creating a 1:1 tuning ratio between the two oscillators, which results in a sawtooth-like FM tone.

Now raise the /Level/ to -20 dB.
OscBLevel.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Oscillator B + Looped Envelopes 
$TargetName Oscillator B + Looped Envelopes

Let's use Oscillator B's envelope to add more complexity to Oscillator A's rhythm.

Set the /Decay/ to 452 ms and the /Sustain/ to -42 dB:
OscBEnv.tif

Then set the envelope Mode to Sync:
RhythmEnvLoop2.tif

And set the /Repeat/ frequency to 1/8:
RhythmRepeat2.tif

The quarter-note rhythm of Oscillator A now incorporates a subtle eighth-note rhythm.

Congratulations, you're halfway done with creating the FM synthesis components of this hybrid texture! Try experimenting with the /Coarse/ tuning of Oscillator B, noticing how different settings change the timbre.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Oscillator C + Looped Envelopes 
$TargetName Oscillator C + Looped Envelopes

We can use Oscillator C to add a repeating soft swell with a half-note rhythm.

To do this, first raise the /Level/ of Oscillator C to -3.5 dB, so that we can hear it in context:
OscCRhythm.tif

In the display, change Oscillator C's /Wave/ to Saw 3 (Sw3) for a bit more timbral subtlety:
OscCSaw.tif

Now, switch the display back to Envelope. Set the /Attack/ to 306 ms, the /Decay/ to 2.11 seconds and the /Sustain/ to -inf dB for a slight fade-in and fade-out:
OscCEnvelopes.tif

As with the other oscillators, set the envelope /Loop/ to Sync, but adjust the /Repeat/ time to 1/2.
RhythmRepeat3.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Oscillator D + Looped Envelopes 
$TargetName Oscillator D + Looped Envelopes

Let's finish the FM aspects of our patch by adding a bright sixteenth-note pulse within the half-note swell.

To do this, we'll first set Oscillator D's /Level/ to -0.0 dB, so that it modulates Oscillator C at full intensity:
OscDLevel.tif

Reduce Oscillator D's /Decay/ to 397 ms and its /Sustain/ to -inf dB for a more percussive sound, and then set the Mode section to Sync at a value of 1/16:
OscDEnvelopes.tif

Now, Oscillator C's undulation will contain a sharp, staccato, sixteenth-note percolation, thanks to the rhythmic FM component.

If you like, you can try out different /Coarse/ and /Level/ settings for Oscillator D, as these can dramatically change the overall character of this part of our sound. As in each of the other lessons, experimentation is the key to mastering Operator!

$Page Filtering the Sound 
$TargetName Filtering the Sound

With our rhythmic FM components in place, let's add some resonant lowpass filtering in order to warm up the sound.

Activate the Filter section with the square button to its left:
FilterOnRhythm.tif

We'll leave the filter type and filter frequency /(Freq)/ at their default values: "Low 12dB" and 500 Hz, and increase the resonance /(Res)/ to 3.70 for some analog-style spice:
FilterSettings.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Looping the Filter Envelope 
$TargetName Looping the Filter Envelope

Since every envelope in Operator can be looped, we'll create a filter envelope rhythm for added complexity.

Set the /Decay/ to 397 ms and the /Sustain/ to 12%:
FilterEnvelopes.tif

Now, turn on Sync and set a /Repeat/ value of 1/4.
FilterSync.tif

From here, we need to increase the /Envelope/ value so the effect can be heard. Try a value of 96%.
EnvelopeAmount.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page The Finishing Touches 
$TargetName The Finishing Touches

To fine-tune the sound, try experimenting with different /Attack,/ /Decay/ and /Repeat/ value settings for the filter envelope, modifying the filter's resonant pulse.

Alternatively, you can adjust the /Time/ and /Tone/ values to further refine the patch.
TimeTone.tif

After you've finalized your filter settings, you can put the finishing polish on this sound by fattening it up with the /Spread/ control. Crank its value all the way up, but remember that this will eat up twice as many voices, no matter how much of the effect you apply.

If you've studied all of the other lessons in this Operator series, you are well on your way to becoming a master of programming Operator. Basses, leads, pads, drums and rhythmic textures are now yours to customize and command. For additional information on the array of synthesis tools available in this instrument, please be sure to read the "Live Instrument Reference" chapter of the $Link reference manual <Manual>.

Remember that the Info View is a great resource that can provide a brief description of any parameter in Operator. You can always show or hide it by pressing the triangular button at the lower left corner of the screen.
