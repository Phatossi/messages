In the previous lessons, we focused on Operator's hybrid synthesis tools. In this lesson, we'll use Operator's four oscillators and smooth filtering options to create a variety of lush pad textures.

As with the other Operator lessons, you will want to get a better view of the instrument in the /Track View,/ folding away the /Info View/ by clicking its Show/Hide button at the lower left corner of the screen.

Now, make Operator's global section available in the display by clicking on it in the shell:
GlobalSectionPad.tif

And select the last algorithm, which contains four parallel oscillators:
LastAlgorithm.tif

We'll begin by working with Oscillator A: Set the /Level/ for Oscillator A to -3.5 dB, leave the /Coarse/ tuning at 1, and raise the /Fine/ tune parameter to 6.

$Page The Envelope and Waveform 
$TargetName The Envelope and Waveform

Let's adjust the oscillator's envelope, softening its attack and release to smooth out the sound.

Making sure Oscillator A is still selected, lengthen the /Attack/ to 29.4 ms and the /Release/ to 759 ms (remember that you can click and type in these values):
OscAEnvelope.tif

Play a few chords and adjust the attack and release to taste.

Note that a longer release time will give a reverb-like tail to chord progressions (at the expense of CPU power, since it requires more polyphony).

Now, switch the /Wave/ to Saw 16 (Sw16), which is similar to the Saw 64 we used in previous Lessons but with fewer high harmonics:
OscASw16.tif

$Page The Second Oscillator 
$TargetName The Second Oscillator

Once you've adjusted the envelope and selected the waveform for Oscillator A, set up Oscillator B's envelope and waveform identically. The easiest way to do this is to switch to Oscillator B's envelope display and then copy the settings using the command available when $ContextMenuing on the display:
CopyOscillator.tif

Then lower Oscillator B's /Coarse/ tuning to 0.5 and raise the /Fine/ tuning to 994:
OscBTuning.tif

This tuning will give the sound a subtle, chorused texture.

Play a few more chords, and you'll hear that we now have a basic pad sound with a touch of resonance, due to the waveform characteristics.

At this point, you can experiment with using different waveforms on Oscillators A and B. When you're done exploring, return their values to Sw16.

$Page Using the Spread Parameter 
$TargetName Using the Spread Parameter

Operator features a lovely chorus-like effect called /Spread./ This function uses two copies of the sound, detuning them slightly and widening the stereo field, an effect that is perfect for enriching a pad (or any other sound, for that matter).

To get the most from this effect, set it to 100% and listen to the results:
Spread.tif

/Note:/ Since the Spread function doubles the sound with a detuned copy, it uses twice the polyphony and also twice the CPU power. If you're on a slower system, use this feature judiciously, or simply record the part as audio to a different clip once you're done creating it. (For more on this, see the "Recording New Clips" chapter of the $Link reference manual <Manual>.

$Page Deepening the Sound 
$TargetName Deepening the Sound

To make the pad richer and deeper, let's use Oscillator C to add a sine wave one octave below Oscillators A and B.

We'll set Oscillator C's /Coarse/ tuning to 0.5 and its /Level/ to -16 dB, so that the low frequencies don't overwhelm the subtlety of our pad:
OscCSettings.tif

From here, we could leave Oscillator C's envelope as it is for more impact, or we could give it a slower attack and release to create a slight swell as chords are held. Try an /Attack/ value of 1.38 seconds and a /Release/ of 882 ms:
OscCEnvelope.tif

$Page Adding Filtering 
$TargetName Adding Filtering

Now, let's use one of Operator's classic /lowpass filters/ to mute the upper harmonics, giving our pad sound a more mellow flavor.

First, activate the filter section with the box at its left-hand side and select the /Low Ladder/ filter from the chooser:
FilterChooser.tif

Now, set the frequency /(Freq)/ to 764 Hz, and leave the Resonance at 1.00:
FilterCutoff.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Producing Phaser Effects 
$TargetName Producing Phaser Effects

Operator is quite capable of creating more animated textures. Let's use Operator's multimode filter options to emulate some classic phaser effects.

First, switch the Filter Mode to /Notch 12dB./
NotchFilter.tif

... and then lower the cutoff frequency /(Freq)/ to 176 Hz.
NotchCutoff.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Looping Envelopes 
$TargetName Looping Envelopes

Now, let's use Operator's unique /envelope looping/ function to turn the filter envelope into an LFO-style animation tool for sweeping the frequency and creating the trademark "whoosh" of a phase-shifter pedal.

To make sure that you are viewing the filter envelope in the display at the center of the instrument, make sure the filter module is selected in the shell and the envelope parameters are selected in the display:
FilterEnvSwitch.tif

Now, begin by setting the /Attack/ to a generous 12.1 seconds, and then set the /Decay/ to 24.4 seconds and the /Release/ to 11.7 seconds. This will create a slow, undulating filter sweep.
FilterEnvSettings.tif

Now activate the envelope looping function by selecting the /Loop/ option in the Mode section...
EnvLoop.tif

... and setting the /Envelope/ amount control to 100%.
EnvelopeAmount.tif

Hold a chord for a minute or so and listen to the filter sweep. You can adjust the rate and shape of the sweep by changing the /Attack/ and /Release/ values.

$TargetName ... and Finally

As you can see, Operator is an extremely flexible pad generator.

If you've also completed the previous lessons, you should by now have a firm grasp on how the various oscillator and FM functions behave. Since we still have an unused oscillator available in this patch, why not experiment with various envelope, waveform and tuning options for Oscillator D?

Alternately, you could switch to a different algorithm and explore more complex FM synthesis techniques. As with any sound design tool, the fastest way to learn Operator is to turn knobs and explore features.

Remember that the Info View is a great resource that can provide a brief description of any parameter in Operator. You can always show or hide it by pressing the triangular button at the lower left corner of the screen.
