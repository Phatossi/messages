$TargetName Instrument Geography: The Shell

Operator combines /FM/ (frequency modulation) synthesis with classic subtractive synthesis, multimode filtering and extensive modulation capabilities, all within an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. The interface is designed to give you immediate access to the most essential parameters in the eight sections of the /shell/ at the right and left sides of the instrument:
TheShell.tif

The left side of Operator's shell is used to select and control each of Operator's four unique oscillators:
OscSection.tif

Each oscillator offers a wide variety of preset waveforms including a number of sine, saw, square, triangle and noise shapes. These can be modified using a waveform editing mode that allows you to adjust the amplitudes of the waveform's partials, taking Operator's sonic palette beyond the usual limitations of FM synthesis. Operator's oscillators can be used in parallel, allowing the creation of classic analog synth sounds, or configured via a variety of modulation algorithms for powerful FM synthesis effects.

$Page LFO, Filter, Pitch and Global Sections
$TargetName LFO, Filter, Pitch and Global Sections

The right side of the shell contains controls used to further sculpt your sound:
OtherSections.tif

The LFO contains a number of waveforms and is even capable of operating at audible frequencies, allowing it to be used as a fifth oscillator. It can modulate the oscillators and filter, as well as a secondary destination. The multimode resonant filter makes shaping your sound simple and includes 14 different filter types. The pitch envelope is capable of modulating each oscillator and the LFO and, like the LFO, can modulate a secondary destination. The global /Time/ and /Tone/ controls are unique to Operator, and we will explore them in depth later in this lesson.

$Page About the Presets
$TargetName About the Presets

To get an idea of the variety of sounds you can generate with Operator, let's try a few presets:

-> *Keys-Road Well Travelled* is a classic FM electric piano.
KeysRoadsWellTravelled.tif

-> *Lead-Minor 7th* uses all four oscillators in parallel to create a one-finger analog chord that smoothly glides from key to key.

-> *Strings-Saw Strings* is a classic analog-style string sound, with chorusing generated by the slight detuning of the oscillators. Notice that there are no additional effects added. Every aspect of the sound is generated using Operator's flexible synthesis architecture.

-> *Rhythmic-Sync To Slave* is a percolating synth patch that demonstrates the flexibility of Operator's envelopes for creating tempo-synched percussive and timbral rhythms.
SyncToSlave.tif

-> *Smack Kick* is a preset that uses Operator's pitch and filter envelopes to create a punchy electronic percussion sound.

This is just a small sampling of Operator's flexibility for creating many types of textures. From digital to analog to electro-mechanical emulations, there's a vast assortment of sounds lurking within this synthesizer.

$Page Editing Sounds: Time and Tone
$TargetName Editing Sounds: Time and Tone

Let's delve deeper into Operator's powerful features. You can quickly alter and personalize the factory presets with Operator's /Time/ and /Tone/ parameters, as well as more familiar synthesis functions such as filtering.

First, let's explore the Time control (located in the lower right of the shell), which lengthens or shortens Operator's envelope segments, allowing you to change a sound from percussive to flowing, or vice versa. The Time control is unique as it puts all seven of Operator's envelopes under the control of a single knob.

Begin by selecting the *Pad-PPG Bell* preset from Operator's $Link *Synth Pad* folder <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Synth Pad>:
PPGBell.tif

This sound has digital chime characteristics with a rich analog-style feel.

Now, increase the Time parameter to *77%* and play a few notes:
TimeParameter.tif

This will change the character of the sound in several ways: The attack will be softened, the decay lengthened and the release time increased so that the sound fades out over a long time.

Now let's decrease the Time parameter to *-100%:*
TimeMinus100.tif

This will give the sound a more percussive feel, suitable for melodies and leads.

$Page More on the Time Parameter
$TargetName More on the Time Parameter

The Time parameter can sometimes create dramatic shifts in the overall texture of a sound. For example, select *Bass-Dangerously Deep* preset from Operator's $Link *Synth Bass* folder <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Synth Bass> and play a couple of notes:
BassDangerouslyDeep.tif

Now, shorten the Time to *-100%* and play the sound again:
TimeMinus100.tif

By reducing the envelope times, we've given this bass sound more impact. In fact, when played low, it could almost function as a kick drum.

Try the opposite setting: Increase the Time parameter to *100%:*
TimePlus100.tif

As you hold the note, notice the long decay much brighter character. The Time knob can completely alter the timbre of a sound!

$Page Transforming Sounds with Tone
$TargetName Transforming Sounds with Tone

Operator also includes an innovative global control called /Tone./ Tone allows dramatic transformations in the character or timbre of a sound. The Tone knob is another quick and effective way to modify a patch.

Select the *Mallets-Real Luxury Vibes* preset from Operator's $Link *Mallets* folder <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Mallets> and play a few notes:
MalletsRealLuxuryVibes.tif

Now, reduce Tone to *0.0%* and play the same notes or a variation in the same range:
ToneControl.tif

Note the sound is much more muted, yet still quite percussive.

Increasing Tone to *100%* emphasizes the characteristic "bell-like" FM aspects of this preset:
TonePlus100.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Transforming Sounds with Tone, Part 2
$TargetName Transforming Sounds with Tone, Part 2

Let's try sweeping the Tone on another Operator preset: Select *Ambient-Magenta Synth* from Operator's $Link *Ambient and Evolving* folder <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Ambient and Evolving> and get a feel for the overall character of this patch by playing a few notes:
AmbientMagentaSynth.tif

Increase the Tone value and listen to how harsh and intense the sound becomes:
TonePlus100.tif

Reduce the Tone value to *0.0%* and the sound becomes much more mellow:
ToneControl.tif

It is important to note that the Tone parameter has a more pronounced effect on patches with a strong FM component. On some patches, the Tone knob will have little, if any, effect.

Experiment with different presets to see which patches respond to the Tone knob most dramatically.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Editing Operator Sounds: The Filters
$TargetName Editing Operator Sounds: The Filters

Operator also delivers extensive multimode /filtering/ options for modifying patches in a manner similar to traditional analog synthesis.

Let's begin checking out the filters by selecting the *Pad-Soft Jupiter* preset from Operator's $Link *Synth Pad* folder <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Synth Pad>. This patch is characterized by warm, muted tones:
PadSoftJupiter.tif

The softened character of this patch is created using a lowpass filter with a low cutoff frequency and moderate resonance.

By increasing the filter cutoff frequency, the character is brightened. Try this and notice how it imparts presence by allowing more high frequencies into the signal:
FilterCutoff.tif

From here, we can lower the cutoff frequency slightly and increase the resonance. This will give the sound a slightly more electronic feel by emphasizing the cutoff frequency:
FilterCutoffAndQ.tif

To quickly visualize and adjust both the cutoff and resonance, switch the filter's display area to show these parameters by clicking the /Filter/ button:
FilterDisplay.tif

The parameters we've covered so far are a great way to quickly customize a preset sound.

We'll be covering most of Operator's features throughout this series of lessons. Nonetheless, to satisfy your curiosity, Operator makes full use of $0's Info View, allowing you to discover the function of each knob, button and/or parameter as your mouse hovers over it. Try this with a few features if you haven't already.
IntroInfoView.tif

Note that if you hid the Info View at the beginning of the lesson, you can show it again using the same button:
HideInfoIntro.tif

Now that you understand the basics, you're ready to go deeper into Operator's programming tools. The next lessons will take you step by step through the process of creating bass, drum, lead, pad and rhythmic texture sounds, so that you'll soon be able to create your own custom sounds from scratch.

In the next Operator lesson, $Link Creating a Bass Patch <Lesson:Builtin/7-Operator Category/OP2-Bass Sounds>, you'll create your first sound with Operator!

As you explore the possibilities, you might be interested in consulting the "$0 Instrument Reference" chapter in Live's $Link Reference Manual <Manual>, which contains a detailed section on Operator. The manual can be always be accessed via the program's /Help/ menu.
