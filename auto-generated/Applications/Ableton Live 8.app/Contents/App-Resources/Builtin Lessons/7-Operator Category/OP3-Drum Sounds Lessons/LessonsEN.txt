In addition to FM and filtering, Operator features complex envelopes and noise generators, making it an excellent resource for drum and percussion sounds of all kinds. Kick drums, snares, toms and even world percussion-like congas can be developed easily, provided you know where to start. In this lesson, we'll explore several different techniques for creating percussive patches.

Let's get started by creating a classic house kick drum...

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page The House Kick Drum
$TargetName The House Kick Drum

By default, Oscillator A is the active oscillator, and the other oscillators are inactive, which you can see from their /Level/ settings of -inf dB.
OscLevels.tif
Let's /fix/ the frequency of Oscillator A, so that the same pitch will be played regardless of which MIDI note is received (something that makes sense for most percussion sounds).

To do this, please click Oscillator A's Fixed button:
FixedButtonDrums.tif
Now, set the frequency /(Freq)/ of Oscillator A to 65.0 Hz, so that there is plenty of room at the low end of the sound:
OscA65.tif
And set Oscillator A's /Level/ to -6.0 dB to allow some dynamic headroom control of volume by velocity:
OscA-6.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Shaping the Sound
$TargetName Shaping the Sound

Now, let's use Oscillator A's /envelope/ to give the sound the right volume contour.

To access the envelope, make sure Oscillator A is still selected in the shell, and set the envelope's /Sustain/ to -inf dB and its /Decay/ to 756 ms. (Remember that you can click on controls and type in exact values.)
SustainAndDecay.tif
These settings will serve as the basis for the overall volume contour of the sound.

In the Level section of the envelope window, set the /Velocity/ amount to 70%.
Velocity70.tif
This will make the volume respond to note velocity, so that you can play dynamic grooves and fills.

$Page A Hip Hop Kick Detour
$TargetName A Hip Hop Kick Detour

Before we continue, let's take a little detour.

If you're a drum n bass or hip hop fan, try increasing the /Decay/ time to around five seconds.
Decay5.tif
Long decay times are the secret to that vintage Roland-style kick drum sound.

You can now toggle the Fixed button on and off, playing as you do so, to hear how this type of kick drum works as a pitched instrument.
FixedButtonDrums.tif
When you've finished experimenting with that classic kick, return the settings to their previous values: /Decay/ at 756 ms and /Fixed/ on.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adding Impact to the Sound
$TargetName Adding Impact to the Sound

Now that we have the basis for our kick drum, let's add some impact. To do this, we'll use the /pitch envelope,/ which is activated using the square button at its left-hand side:
PitchEnvOn.tif
Please set the /Pitch Env/ amount to 50%:
PitchEnv50.tif

Let's adjust the contour of the pitch envelope in the display as follows:

Set the /Initial/ value to 0 st (0 semitones), leave the /Attack/ at 0.10 ms (instantaneous), and change the /Peak/ value to +48 st and the /Decay/ to 84.8 ms:
DrumsPitchContour.tif
We can leave the /Sustain/ and /Release/ values at their default settings.

This envelope will raise the pitch immediately to +48 semitones and drop it back to zero in 84.8 milliseconds, creating the punchy attack that is a characteristic of classic analog drum machine sounds and a solid foundation for house or trance beats.

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Some Quick Disco Funk
$TargetName Some Quick Disco Funk

Let's see how Operator excels at creating a wide variety of drum sounds by quickly turning this kick drum into a funky disco tom sound from the '70s.

Still working in the pitch envelope section of the display, lengthen the /Decay/ to around 3.11 seconds, giving the drum that trademark disco sound:
DecayTom.tif

You can also adjust the /slope/ of the pitch envelope's segments. To toggle the envelope controls between breakpoints and slopes, click this button:
SlopesToggle.tif
or click any of the diamonds on the envelope segments in the display:
SlopeBreakpoints.tif

Now try adjusting the /D. Slope/ amount and listen to how the intensity of the pitch bend changes. Set this parameter back to 100% before moving on.

Since a tom-tom is a pitched instrument, return to Oscillator A and turn the /Fixed/ tuning function off, leaving the /Coarse/ tuning at 1.
FixedOff.tif

Now, play the tom sound across the keyboard range.

$Page Creating an Analog Snare
$TargetName Creating an Analog Snare

The final sound that we'll be creating in this lesson is a classic analog snare sound.

Restore Operator to its default values by double-clicking the Operator folder in the Device Browser:
OperatorInBrowserDrum.tif

This time we'll use a different one of Operator's /algorithms./ To access the algorithms, select the global section of the shell so that it's highlighted, like this:
GlobalSectionDrums.tif
The algorithms will appear at the top of Operator's display.

Select the option in which Oscillator D modulates Oscillators A, B and C:
Algorithms.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Waveform and Envelope Settings
$TargetName Waveform and Envelope Settings

Oscillator A will provide the snare noise component of the sound, so select it from the shell and set its /Wave/ type to Noise White.
DrumsNoiseWave.tif

Notice that when you changed the waveform, the upper half of the display changed as well. You can toggle between displaying an oscillator's envelope and its waveform settings with these switches:
EnvelopeOscillatorSwitches.tif

Now, give Oscillator A an envelope with a /Sustain/ setting of -inf dB and a fairly rapid /Decay/ of 452 ms:
SnareEnvelope.tif

Set the Level section's /Velocity/ amount at 70%, so that the drum is dynamically playable via MIDI.
Velocity70.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Snare Tuning and Levels
$TargetName Snare Tuning and Levels

Operator's white noise waveform doesn't have adjustable tuning. There is an additional noise waveform, however, that uses a short looped sample which can be tuned. To try this, select the Noise Looped waveform:
DrumsNoiseLooped.tif

Then activate the /Fixed/ tuning function again.
FixedButtonDrums.tif
Now, sweep the frequency /(Freq)/ knob to the left and right in order to get an idea of the full range of options available from this noise waveform.

Once you're done checking out the variety, set the /Freq/ parameter to 303 Hz and decrease the /Level/ to -6.0 dB.
SnareFreqLev.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adding Body to the Sound
$TargetName Adding Body to the Sound

While the noise waveform serves as the basis for this snare, we still need to add some body to the sound. We can do this by adding Oscillator C.

First, select it and switch it to Fixed Mode. Then tune the pitched sine wave to around 123 Hz to give the sound a more rounded character, and set the /Level/ to -9.0 dB so that this component doesn't overwhelm the noise aspect of the sound.
OscCSettings.tif

Now, let's shape the envelope of Oscillator C so that it matches the contour of Oscillator A:

/Decay/ = 452 ms, /Sustain/ = -inf dB and the Level section's /Velocity/ amount = 70%.
OscCEnvelope.tif

$Comment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Adding FM
$TargetName Adding FM

At this point, the snare should sound pretty familiar, like a retro '80s snare from your favorite electropop or electroclash hits. Even so, let's add a little FM spice to the sound.

Switch to Oscillator D and toggle /Fixed/ tuning on. Set the frequency /(Freq)/ parameter to 483 Hz and the /Level/ to -13 dB:
OscDSettings.tif

If you play a few notes now, you will hear that adding Oscillator D as an FM modulation source gives the sound a metallic edge. This can be useful for other types of percussion, such as cowbells, high hats and triangles, so take a moment to experiment with various frequency settings.

Return the value to 483 Hz when you're done.

When one oscillator modulates another, its envelope contour determines how much modulation occurs over time. In this case, we want Oscillator D to emphasize the snare's attack transients, so its envelope should match the settings used for Oscillator A. You can copy the envelope from one oscillator to another by $ContextMenuing in the envelope display:
CopyEnvelope.tif

Notice that the metallic character has been replaced by a punchier, crisper attack. Now, try alternate /Decay/ settings and pick the one you like best.

As you can see, Operator is a rich source for drum sounds. While it's extremely useful for electronic percussion, it's also capable of more organic sounds like woodblocks and mallet percussion. Check out some of the presets in Operator's $Link *Drums* <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Drums> and $Link *Mallets* <BrowseLibraryPresets:/Instruments/Operator/Mallets> folders and examine their parameter settings for insight into the way the sounds were created.

In the next lesson, we'll explore the various types of lead and melodic sounds that Operator can produce.

Remember that the Info View is a great resource that can provide a brief description of any parameter in Operator. You can always show or hide it by pressing the triangular button at the lower left corner of the screen.
