$TargetName The $0 LE Interface

The basic building blocks of $0 are called /clips./  A clip is a piece of musical material: a melody, drum pattern, bass line or even a complete song.

Most of your work in $0 will consist of creating, editing and combining clips in order to build larger musical structures. You can do this in two separate views, called the /Arrangement/ and the /Session./

Clips in Session view appear like this:
SessionClips.tif

Clips in the Arrangement look like this:
ArrangementClips.tif

You can quickly alternate between the two views with your computer's *Tab* key or with the view selectors:
ViewSelectors.tif

$TargetName Opening the Browser and Library

There are many ways to create or import data in $0, but the easiest way is to drag it in from the /Browser./ You can toggle the Browser's visibility with its selector button or via $ViewPanMod-B:
BrowserSelector.tif

You can use the Browser to navigate to any location on your drives, as well as to $0's /Library,/ which is where you can find $0's pre-installed content. To get to the Library, first open one of the three /File Browsers/ by using its selector:
FileBrowserSelectors.tif

Then select the Library /bookmark/ at the top of the Browser:
LibraryBookmark.tif

The Library's /Clips/ folder contains pre-made clips that you can use in your projects right away. These combine MIDI data, instruments and effects into a single container. Let's load one now. First, switch to Session view if you're not already there:
SessionView.tif

Then navigate to the /Clips/ folder, select a clip, and drag it into an empty slot in the Session:
ClipToSlot.tif

You can also drag in raw audio files from the Library's /Samples/ folder to automatically create new clips. MIDI and audio clips work in much the same way, and can live side-by-side in your projects.

Once you've loaded some clips, you can /launch/ them by pressing their play buttons:
PlayButtons.tif

Each clip has its own play button, which allows clips to be launched independently from one another. A row of clips is called a /scene./ Clips arranged in scenes can all be launched simultaneously by pressing the /Scene Launch/ button in the Master track:
SceneLaunch.tif

$Page Installing and Using $0 Content 
$TargetName Installing and Using $0 Content

$0 LE comes with a selection of pre-installed content that can help you get acquainted with the program as well as jump-start your own creative work. This includes:

-> the /Simpler/ and /Impulse/ instruments;
-> several /Live Packs,/ which provide the additional lessons as well as presets for the instruments and Live effects devices;
-> a collection of /demo songs/ that you can listen to and analyze to learn more about $0 LE's capabilities.

$0 LE also comes with additional content that is not automatically installed, but that you can install on your own. This includes:

-> the /Essential Instruments Collection LE Edition./ This pack of high-quality multisampled instruments provides a wide variety of "bread-and-butter" Simpler instruments, ready to play;
-> /Unnatural Selection,/ a collection of loops, beats and instrument presets by $Link Puremagnetik <http://www.puremagnetik.com/>.

Live Packs can be installed in several ways, but the easiest is to use the *Install Live Pack* command from the *File Menu.* This will open a normal operating system window that will allow you to navigate to the additional Live Packs.

In addition to this free content, $0 LE includes Live Packs that install presets for /Operator/ and /Sampler./ These are instruments that are not included with $0 LE, but are available for purchase separately from the $Link Ableton webshop <http://www.ableton.com/shop>. You can also try them right away by enabling $Link /Demo Mode./ <Lesson:Builtin/Demo Mode> Demo Mode allows you to explore an add-on product's functionality, but without the ability to save or export your work.

If you'd like to sit back and relax while learning about $0, we've also created a number of /instructional movies/ that teach about specific aspects of $0's functionality. You can find these on your installation disk or at the $Link Ableton website <http://www.ableton.com/movies>.

(Please note that some of these movies discuss features in the full version of $0 that may not be applicable to Live LE.)
