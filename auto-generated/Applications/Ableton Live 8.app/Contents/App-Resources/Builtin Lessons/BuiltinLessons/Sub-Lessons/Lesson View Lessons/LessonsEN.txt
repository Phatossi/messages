This is $0's /Help View./ You can reach it at any time by selecting *Help View* from the Help menu.

A large number of hands-on tutorials are included here which demonstrate $0's unique features and workflow. This page will explain how to find your way around the Help View.

MetaView.tif

The title bar at the top of the Help View shows, from left to right: A button to close the Help View; The name of the current page; The Back, Forward, and Home buttons.

/Back/ and /Forward/ switch between entire lessons, for example after following a /hyperlink/ from one lesson to another. You can recognize hyperlinks by their exclusive use of $Link underlined text <>.

In most cases, you'll navigate through lessons using the buttons found at the bottom of the Help View. At the moment, these are labeled *Return* and *Next Page.*

A vertical scroll bar on the right side rounds out the Help View's feature set, helping you make your way through longer pages.

To get context-sensitive help as you work with $0, unfold the /Info View:/
OverviewInfoView.tif

It's a very handy resource that will tell you about almost anything that you point your mouse over. Like many other views in $0, it can be shown or hidden as needed just by clicking the triangular /unfold/ button near its lower-left corner.

The most extensive documentation of $0's features and concepts can be found in the $Link Reference Manual <Manual>, which can be always be accessed by selecting *Read the Live Manual...* from the Help menu.
