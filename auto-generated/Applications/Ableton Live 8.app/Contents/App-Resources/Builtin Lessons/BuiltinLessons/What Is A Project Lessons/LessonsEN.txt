A Live Project is a folder which can be used to organize any related Live Sets, Clips, presets or other files.

Consider, for example, working on a piece of music: You begin with an empty Live Set; you record audio and thereby create new sample files; you drag in samples from collections; you save different versions of the Live Set along the way so that you can go back and compare.

All the files related to this piece of music will be stored in the project folder - and $0's /File Manager/ will provide the tools you need to manage them.

Live Sets are always saved within a Live Project, but you don't have to worry about creating project folders manually: Live creates them automatically if they don't already exist.
