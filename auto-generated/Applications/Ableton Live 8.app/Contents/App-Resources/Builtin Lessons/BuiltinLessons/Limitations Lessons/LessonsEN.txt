If you're seeing this Lesson, Live probably just told you that something you tried to do wasn't possible. There are two common reasons for this:

-> You're using a version of Live with feature limitations, such as Live Lite or Live Intro.

-> You're trying to open a Set that uses some Ableton add-on products that you don't own.

Here are a few ways to get around these limitations:

*Free trial licenses*
Try out all the features, including saving and exporting, for a limited time. Go to $FreeTrialLink to get started.

*Instant Purchase*
Products purchased at $Link www.ableton.com/shop <http://www.ableton.com/shop> can, in most cases, be used immediately.  Software instruments such as Operator and Collision do not even require downloading, and can be used after re-authorizing your existing Live installation.

*Using add-on products with saving and exporting disabled*
You can switch between using Live alone and using Live with all of the available add-ons. To see the available options, go to the User Account/Licenses $Link Preferences <Pref:null> and enable "Show all products at startup."
