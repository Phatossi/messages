$Page The File List 
$TargetName The File List

The file list displays each sample used by the Live Set which you're inspecting:
FileList.tif

You can replace any sample in the list by dropping a new sample onto it. Audio clips will retain their Warp Markers if the length of the new sample is equal to or greater than the old sample. You can also use the /Hot-Swap/ button to replace a sample by browsing.

Click a sample's /Edit/ button to open it in an external sample editor. The sample will remain offline as long as the Edit switch is engaged. Audio clips will retain their Warp Markers /only/ if the sample length remains unchanged.

The /Location/ column indicates whether samples are located in $0's Library, in a project folder, or in another external folder. Missing samples are also indicated here.

If $0 has searched for missing files, the number of potential matches is listed in the /Candidates/ column.
