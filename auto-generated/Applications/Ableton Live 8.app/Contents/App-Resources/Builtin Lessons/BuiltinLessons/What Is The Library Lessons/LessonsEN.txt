$TargetName What is the Library?

$0's /Library/ is the place to store sounds and presets which should be accessible to any Project.
Library.tif

You can access your Library content using the bookmarks menu in any of $0's File Browsers:
LibraryMenu.tif

The Library includes presets, loops, grooves, and other sound ideas courtesy of Ableton. We encourage you to experiment with this material to get a sense of what the program can do.

Ableton provides additional Library content in the form of /Live Packs./ The boxed version of Live ships with several gigabytes of multisampled instruments and you'll find more Live Packs on the $Link Ableton website <http://www.ableton.com/downloads>.
