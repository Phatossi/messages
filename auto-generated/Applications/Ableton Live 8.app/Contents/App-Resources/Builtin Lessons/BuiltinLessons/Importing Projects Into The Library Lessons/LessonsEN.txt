$TargetName Exporting Projects to the Library

Any Live Clips, samples, or presets which you store in $0's Library are available to any Project. You can use the File Manager's /Export/ button to copy all of the files from the Project which you are managing into the Library:
ExportSection.tif

Your Project will be unaffected by the export process, since its files are only copied, not moved.

*Note:* If you want to delete a Project after exporting, use $0's File Browser.
