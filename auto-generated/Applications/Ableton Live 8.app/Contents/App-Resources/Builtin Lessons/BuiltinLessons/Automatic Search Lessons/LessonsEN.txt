To manually fix a broken sample reference, locate the missing sample in the File Browser:
MissingSampleInBrowser.tif

Drag the file from the File Browser, and drop it on the corresponding entry in the File Manager's missing file list:
LocatedMissingSample.tif

Note that you can update the file reference using any sample file you wish; it doesn't have to be the same file that was missing.


Please press the /Next Page/ button below to learn about the File Manager's Automatic Search.

$TargetName Automatic Search

The File Manager's Automatic Search function is often the easiest way to repair broken sample references:
AutomaticSearchSection.tif

You can click the /Go/ button to begin searching immediately, or unfold the triangle on the left to reveal search options:

-> *Search folder* includes a user-defined folder in the search;
-> *Search Project* includes the current Set's project folder;
-> *Search Library* includes $0's Library;
-> *Search near samples already found* includes the folders of any previously located samples;
-> *Require exact matches* only returns results which exactly match the missing samples;
-> *Fully rescan folders* completely rebuilds $0's search index, finding any samples which have been added or moved by other applications.


For each missing sample, the Automatic Search may find any number of /candidates,/ or possible matches:

-> If no candidates are found, you can either restart the search using fewer constraints or locate the sample manually;
-> When one candidate is found, $0 accepts the candidate and considers the problem solved;
-> If several candidates are found, click the entry's /Hot-Swap/ button, shown below; the candidates will be listed in the File Browser:
HotSwapMissingSample.tif
