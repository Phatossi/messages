First, please verify that your Axiom (2nd gen) is connected to your computer, and powered on. Windows users who haven't performed this step before launching $0 will need to restart $0 before the Axiom (2nd gen) can be recognized.

Open $0's Preferences by selecting /Preferences/ from the $0 menu (MacOS) or the 'Options' menu (Windows). Then select the /MIDI/Sync/ tab.

In the upper section, select Axiom (2nd gen) from the /Control Surface/ chooser, then define the MIDI Input and Output ports which it is connected to.

Finally, close $0's Preferences.

Several important buttons are located below the LCD display, and work as follows:

-> *Track <:* selects the previous track and record arms (if new track is a MIDI track).
-> *Track >:* selects the next track and record arms (if new track is a MIDI track).
-> *Mute:* Mutes the selected track.
-> *Inst:* Maps the encoders to the instrument within the selected track.

With Shift held, the buttons do the following;

-> *Shift + Track <:* banks eight tracks to the left.
-> *Shift + Track >:* banks eight tracks to the right.
-> *Shift + Mute:* solos the selected track.

mk2Transport.tif

The Axiom (2nd gen)'s /transport buttons/ control the following functions in Session View:

-> LOOP: triggers the scene playback
-> REWIND: selects the previous scene
-> FORWARD: selects the next scene
-> STOP: stops Live's global transport
-> PLAY: plays Live's global transport
-> RECORD: starts Arrangement recording

The transport buttons also control functions in Arrangement View. Using the Shift button expands some of the functionality of these buttons.

-> LOOP: Toggles loop on/off
-> REWIND: Goes back one bar (Shift + REW: Go to Start)
-> FORWARD: Goes forward one bar (Shift + FWD: Go to End)
-> STOP: Stops
-> PLAY: Plays
-> RECORD: Records

mk2Mixer.tif

The Axiom (2nd gen)'s faders control the current eight tracks, plus the master track.

The Fader buttons mute the current eight tracks. Holding F18 while pressing a fader button solos the track.

Note that the Axiom (2nd gen) 25 has only one fader, which controls the volume of the currently selected track.

Axiommk2Patch.tif

Axiommk2Encoders.tif

Encoders and Patch buttons work together to give you control over your Live device parameters. If no device is present in a track, the encoders have no function. The target of the encoders is affected by the Patch buttons as follows:

-> *Patch Up:* Next bank of parameters (Shift + Patch Up: Move to next device in track)
-> *Patch Down:* Previous bank of parameters (Shift + Patch Down: Move to previous device in track)

When selecting a track, the encoders will map to the previously selected device in that track. If the Inst button is active, however, the encoders will always map to the instrument in the track (if available).

If a new device is created within a track, it will automatically be selected as the active device within that track.

/Peek/
If the Shift button is held down and an Encoder is turned on the Axiom (2nd gen), Live will not change the parameter's value, but will display the name and value of the parameter.

Axiommk2Pads.tif

By default, the pads map to the eight pads of Impulse or the first eight pads of a Drum Rack. However, with the Shift button held down, the pads will trigger the clip within the selected scene, as is the case with the Axiom classic control surface. The pads map to the active bank, such that if the user has banked to tracks 9-16, pads P1-P8 trigger the clips on track 9-16 respectively.
