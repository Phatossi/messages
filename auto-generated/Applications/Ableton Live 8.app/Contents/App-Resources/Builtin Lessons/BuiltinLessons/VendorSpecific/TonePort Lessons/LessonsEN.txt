/Welcome to $0!/

/Ableton Live Lite/ delivers much of the functionality of Ableton Live, the multi-award-winning music production solution. This short lesson will help you configure $0 for use with your Line 6 audio interface.

Before we begin:
-> Launch the Line 6 /POD Farm/ application; If you haven't yet installed POD Farm, please quit $0 and do that now;
-> Verify that your Line 6 audio interface is connected to your computer and powered on. (Windows users note: On Windows, USB devices must be connected and recognized by the operating system /before/ launching $0.)
-> Connect your microphone or instrument to the relevant input on the audio interface;
-> Connect the audio output of the audio interface to a pair of headphones or speakers.

$0's documents are known as Live Sets. This lesson is accompanied by a Live Set which you'll be interacting with as you follow the lesson. Whenever you're ready, $Link *please click here* <Set:/Sets/Guitar Tutorial.als> to load the Live Set.

*Note:* Not all Line 6 devices provide MIDI support or all the audio input features described in this tutorial. Please refer to your product's documentation for device-specific information.

Please press the /Next Page/ button below to continue.

$Page Finding Guidance 
$TargetName Finding Guidance

Let's start by introducing a couple of resources which will be helpful as you get to know $0. The first is the /Info View:/
OverviewInfoView.tif

The Info View resides in the lower-left corner of the $0 application window. It's a very handy resource that will tell you about almost anything that you point your mouse over. Like many other views in $0, it can be shown or hidden as needed just by clicking the triangular /unfold/ button near its lower-left corner:
InfoViewFoldButton.tif

For more in-depth discussions of Live's features, you can also access the complete Reference Manual via the Help menu:
HelpMenu.tif

The Help menu also leads to $0's built-in /lessons,/ which you're reading from right now. There are several other lessons included which will help you explore $0's possibilities. Be sure to check them out!

$Page Setting Up Audio I/O 
$TargetName Setting Up Audio I/O

For our first step, we'll configure $0's audio I/O. Open $0's /Preferences/ by selecting them from the Options menu (or the Live menu in Mac OS X), then click on the /Audio/ tab:
AudioTab.tif

At the top of this tab you'll find the /Driver Type/ chooser:
DriverTypeMac.tif

-> Mac users will set the Driver Type to *CoreAudio.*
-> PC users will want to set the Driver Type to *ASIO.*

Now that we've defined the type of driver which we'll use, we can select the driver itself. Select the driver for your Line 6 interface from (Mac) both the /Audio Input Device/ and /Audio Output Device/ choosers or (PC) the /Audio Device/ chooser:
TonePortAudioDeviceSansTonePort.tif

Many of the Line 6 audio interfaces are capable of recording multiple sources at once, such as vocals and guitar. To enable all of these inputs, click the /Input Config/ button:
InputConfigButton.tif

Now make sure that both stereo pairs are enabled:
ConfigInputChannels.tif

Click *OK* to return.

$Page MIDI Control with Line 6 Devices
$TargetName MIDI Control with Line 6 Devices

Now let's switch to the /MIDI/Sync/ tab, where we can establish MIDI communication between $0 and the audio interface:
POD_Studio_MidiTab.tif

In the lower half of this tab, you'll find the /MIDI Ports/ section. Your Line 6 audio interface should be listed here as both an input and an output (You may have to scroll to see all available devices):
MidiPortsPOD_Studio.tif

To allow the audio interface to control $0's interface remotely, we'll enable the /Remote/ switch for the audio interface's /Input:/
RemoteEnabledPOD_Studio.tif

You can close $0's Preferences now.

$Page POD Farm Settings
$TargetName POD Farm Settings

In our next step, we're going to configure the Line 6 POD Farm software. For more information, please refer to the documentation that came with it. For right now, we want to select *Instrument* from Tone 1 and *Mic* from Tone 2 using POD Farm's /Source Select/ menus:
InstMic.tif

Next, open POD Farm's preferences, and select the /MIDI/Control/ tab. Click the button labeled /Line 6 Audio-MIDI Devices:/
GearBoxMidiPrefs.tif

In the /Controller Mapping/ section of the /MIDI/ tab, select the *Ableton Live* preset:
GearBoxLivePreset.tif

Now press the /Settings.../ button to display the audio interface's controller mappings:
GearBoxSettingsWide.tif

-> If all of the entries in the section highlighted above say *None,* we'll need to manually enter some information before continuing. $Link Please click here <Lesson:Builtin/BuiltinLessons/VendorSpecific/KB37 Controller Mappings>.
-> If there are already MIDI CCs assigned to these functions, you can simply click *Cancel,* close the POD Farm preferences, and continue with the lesson.

Your Line 6 audio interface should now be set up for remote control of $0's interface.

You can verify that the KB37 is communicating with $0 by touching its knobs or buttons. As you do this, $0 will acknowledge that control messages are being received by flashing its /MIDI In/ indicator, located in the upper-right corner of the application window:
MidiIndicator.tif

*Note:* UX2 and UX8 send MIDI via foot controllers.

$Page Setting up Monitoring 
$TargetName Setting up Monitoring

Next, we have to set up $0's monitoring. With many audio interfaces, you might experience latency - undesirable delays that audio signals can experience on their way to and from the computer. Luckily, Line 6 audio interfaces with POD Farm offer the unique ToneDirect monitoring solution, which virtually eliminates latency.

We're going to turn off $0's /auto input monitoring/ for each track which we might record into, so that we won't hear a "doubled" sound.

First, let's make sure that the /I/O/ section of the mixer is visible. It can be toggled on and off with a dedicated selector in the mixer's lower-right corner:
IoSelector.tif

With the I/O section visible, we can disable monitoring for individual tracks by selecting the /OFF/ switch. Please do this now for track 1, *Lead Guitar,* which we'll be recording into in a moment:
MonitoringOff.tif

$Page Recording a Take 
$TargetName Recording a Take

We've prepared some backing tracks in $0's Arrangement View so that you have something to play along to:
BackingTracks.tif

Let's take a moment to get familiar with what's here before we record a take. Press the Control Bar's /Stop/ button twice, to make sure that playback will begin at the start of the Live Set:
TransportStopRec.tif

Now press the Control Bar's /Play/ button (or hit the *space bar* on your computer's keyboard):
TransportPlayRec.tif

Whenever you feel ready, press the Stop button twice again to reset the starting position to *1.1.1.* Next, press the adjacent /Global Record/ button (This is probably familiar to those of you who have used multitrack tape machines: Individual tracks can be armed for recording, then the Global Record button enables recording for those armed tracks.):
GlobalRecordRec.tif

Finally, press the Play button to begin recording:
TransportPlayRec.tif

Now's the time to make some noise!


$Comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Page Recording and Playback 
$TargetName Recording and Playback

As recording progresses, you'll see a new /audio clip/ being created in the track:
ArrangementClipRecording.tif

To stop recording, press the Stop button in the Control Bar, or hit the *space bar* again:
TransportStopRec.tif

Now, press the Stop button one more time (resetting the Arrangement to *1.1.1* again), and listen to your recording by pressing the Play button.

If you're not satisfied with what you've recorded, don't fret! A quick press of *$CommandMod + Z* is all that's needed to undo a take, and be ready to try again.

If you recorded for long enough, the Arrangement may have started to scroll horizontally. To scroll the view backward or forward, or to zoom in or out, grab the beat-time ruler along the top of the Arrangement with the mouse:
-> Vertical mouse movements /zoom/ in and out;
-> Horizontal movements /scroll/ left and right.
TimeLineRec.tif

Playback and recording can start from any point in the song. You can set an /insert mark/ by clicking anywhere in the Arrangement View (except on a clip's title bar), and the song will start playing from that point next time.
InsertMarker.tif

$Page Recording Two Inputs 
$TargetName Recording Two Inputs

If your Line 6 audio interface has multiple inputs, we can use the audio interface's simultaneous recording capability to record a microphone and an instrument at the same time. Let's set up a second audio track for the mic channel.

Click on the /unfold/ button for the track *6 Audio:*
TrackUnfold.tif

First, turn the track's input monitoring *OFF* so that we can use ToneDirect monitoring. Then, in the /Input Channel/ chooser above, select the audio interface's microphone inputs, *3/4:*
SecondTrackMonitoring.tif

A track's /Arm/ button enables it for recording, but by default, only one track can be armed at a time. To enable track 6 in addition to track 1, hold the *$CommandMod* key as you click on track 6's Arm button:
TwoTracksArmed.tif

Now prepare for recording by enabling the Global Record button once again:
GlobalRecordRec.tif

Press Play to begin recording. Your instrument will record into track 1 like before, and your microphone will record into track 6!

$Page Tweaking Your Guitar Sounds 
$TargetName Tweaking Your Guitar Sounds

While your Line 6 audio interface has an excellent set of onboard effects, it's often desirable to apply effects /after/ you've recorded, so that they aren't a permanent part of the recording. $0 comes with a great selection of effects and virtual instruments, which are available in the /Device Browser:/
DeviceBrowserSelector.tif

Press the *spacebar* to start playback again. Next, click on the name of an effect from the Device Browser, such as /Ping Pong Delay,/ and drag it onto the *Lead Guitar* track:
PingPong.tif

You'll immediately hear echoes superimposed onto your playing. Try clicking and dragging in the /XY/ grid to change the sound.

For that classic trippy sound, let's reverse the lead: Double-click on the clip that you just recorded. It's properties will be displayed at the bottom of the screen in $0's /Clip View./ Press the /Reverse/ button shown here, then listen to the result:
ReverseButton.tif

$Page MIDI Map Mode 
$TargetName MIDI Map Mode

You can control almost any of $0's functions remotely using the integrated MIDI keyboard found on the Line 6 KB37. We'll customize a few mappings using the knobs on its left side:
KB37LeftKnobs.tif

MIDI remote control assignments are defined in /MIDI Map Mode./ Press the /MIDI/ switch in the upper-right corner of the screen to enter MIDI Map Mode:
MidiMapSwitch.tif

Notice that all parameters which are capable of remote control appear highlighted whenever MIDI Map Mode is active.

Now we can assign knobs or keys on the KB37 to controls in $0. Click /once/ to select one of $0's parameters, then turn a knob or press a button on the KB37 to create the assignment. Exit MIDI Map mode, and you're ready to go!

Some controls on the KB37, such as the /transport buttons,/ have been pre-mapped to parameters in $0:
TransportButtons.tif

These buttons function as follows, from left to right:
-> Toggle the metronome On/Off
-> Toggle the Arrangement Loop On/Off
-> Stop
-> Play
-> Toggle the Global Record button On/Off

The UX2, UX8 and KB37 also add footswitch control to $0. *Footswitch 1* toggles Play/Stop:
PlayStop.tif

*Footswitch 2* toggles the Global Record button On/Off:
GlobalRecordRec.tif

$TargetName Where to Go from Here?

You're up and running now with $0 and your Line 6 audio interface, but there are many more possibilities for guitarists using $0!

-> You can record another guitarist's performance into $0, then slow it down dramatically to make learning and transcription easier.
-> By slowing down tricky chord changes, you can build up your jazz chops until your fingers catch up. For advanced jazzheads, try playing over random chord changes created by clip /Follow Actions./
-> The File menu's *Export Audio* command can export $0's Master output as a new sample. The resulting file can be used to burn an audio CD for listening purposes or a data CD, which can serve as a backup of your work.
-> Those leaning toward the experimental end of the spectrum might make creative use of $0's warping and pitch shifting capabilities.
-> To learn more about recording in $0, check out the $Link Recording Audio <Lesson:Builtin/1-Live Basics Category/2-Recording Audio> lesson.

Whatever your musical tastes, $0 can help you enjoy your guitar and improve your music. To work with unlimited tracks, scenes, effects and more, upgrade to the full version of Live $Link here <http://www.ableton.com/upgrade>.
