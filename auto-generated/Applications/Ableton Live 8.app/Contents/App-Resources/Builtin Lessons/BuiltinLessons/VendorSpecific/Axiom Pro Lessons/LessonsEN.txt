First, please verify that your Axiom Pro is connected to your computer, and powered on. Windows users who haven't performed this step before launching $0 will need to restart $0 before the Axiom Pro can be recognized.

Open $0's Preferences by selecting /Preferences/ from the $0 menu (MacOS) or the 'Options' menu (Windows). Then select the /MIDI/Sync/ tab.

In the upper section, select Axiom Pro from the /Control Surface/ chooser, then define the MIDI Input and Output ports which it is connected to.

Finally, close $0's Preferences.

The Axiom Pro is toggled between /Mixer Mode/ and /Device Mode/ by pressing F1.

In Mixer Mode, the 8 knobs control a variety of mixer-related parameters (depending on the current /page,/ which is selected via the soft-keys immediately below the display.)

In Device Mode, the 8 knobs control parameters for the currently selected device. As in Mixer Mode, you can use the soft-keys to switch to additional pages for devices with more than 8 parameters.

The F keys always have the same functions, regardless of mode:

-> F1: Mode selection (Mixer or Device)
-> F2: Select the previous track
-> F3: Select the next track
-> F4: Mute the selected track
-> F5: Solo the selected track
-> F6: Enable the previous /bank/ of eight tracks
-> F7: Enable the next /bank/ of eight tracks

The track-selection buttons also include any return tracks.
The Axiom Pro's display always updates to show the values of track and device parameters as you adjust them in Live or on the hardware.

Depending on which model of Axiom Pro you have, the 8 knobs will function slightly differently in Mixer Mode. For the Axiom Pro 25, the knobs control the following parameters:

-> Page 1: Volume of the eight available tracks
-> Page 2: Pan of the eight available tracks
-> Page 3: Send 1 levels for the eight available tracks
-> Page 4: Send 2 levels for the eight available tracks

For the Axiom Pro 49 and 61, the knobs control:

-> Page 1: Pan of the eight available tracks
-> Page 2: Send 1 levels for the eight available tracks
-> Page 3: Send 2 levels for the eight available tracks
-> Page 4: Send 3 levels for the eight available tracks

On the Axiom Pro 49 and 61, the sliders and buttons below them control the following (in both Mixer and Device Mode):

-> Sliders 1-8: Volume of the eight available tracks.
-> Slider 9: Master Volume
-> Slider Buttons 1-8: Select, arm, activate or solo the eight available tracks. 
-> Slider Button 9: Toggles between select, arm, activate and solo modes. The selected mode will be briefly shown in the display.

(Please note that the sliders and slider buttons are not available on the Axiom Pro 25.)

The Axiom Pro will control the device which was last selected or which is currently active. If this device is a Rack, the knobs will automatically adjust the Macro Controls. If any other device is selected, the knobs will control parameters specific to that device. The current knob mappings, as well as the current value of the parameters, is always shown in the display.

Some of $0's devices have more than 8 parameters. In this case, the parameters are divided into pages which, as in Mixer Mode, can be changed via the keys immediately below the display.
